## CHAPTER I.<BR>THE BEGINNINGS

### Launching the Liberty League

<p class="reviewedauthor">(From *The Voice* of July 4, 1917.)</p>

The Liberty League of Negro-Americans, which was recently
organized by the Negroes of New York, presents the most startling program of any organization of Negroes in the country
today. This is nothing less than the demand that the Negroes
of the United States be given a chance to enthuse over democracy 
for themselves in America before they are expected to
enthuse over democracy in Europe. The League is composed of
“Negro-Americans, loyal to their country in every respect, and
obedient to her laws.”

The League has an interesting history. It grew out of the labors
of Mr. Hubert H. Harrison, who has been on the lecture platform 
for years and is well and favorably known to thousands
of white New Yorkers from Wall Street to Washington Heights.

Two years ago Mr. Harrison withdrew from an international
political organization, and, a little more than a year ago, gave
up lecturing to white people, to devote himself to lecturing exclusively 
among his own people. He acquired so much influence
among them that when he issued the first call for a mass-meeting
“to protest against lynching in the land of liberty and disfranchisement 
in the home of democracy,” although the call was
not advertised in any newspaper, the church in which the meeting
was held was packed from top to bottom. At this mass-meeting, 
which was held at Bethel Church on June 12, the
organization was effected and funds were raised to sustain it and
to extend its work all over the country.

Harrison was subsequently elected its president, with Edgar
Grey and James Harris as secretary and treasurer, respectively.
At the close of this mass-meeting he hurriedly took the midnight 
train for Boston, where a call for a similar meeting had
been issued by W. Monroe Trotter, editor of *The Boston Guardian*. 
While there he delivered an address in Fanueil Hall, the
cradle of American liberty, and told the Negroes of Boston what
their brothers in New York had done and were doing. The
result was the linking up of the New York and the Boston
organizations, and Harrison was elected chairman of a national
committee of arrangements to issue a call to every Negro organization 
in the country to send delegates to a great race-congress
which is to meet in Washington in September or October and put
their grievances before the country and Congress.

At the New York mass-meeting money was subscribed for the
establishment of a newspaper to be known as The Voice and to
serve as the medium of expression for the new demands and
aspirations of the new Negro. It was made clear that this “New
Negro Movement” represented a breaking away of the Negro
masses from the grip of the old-time leaders&mdash;none of whom was
represented at the meeting. The audience rose to their feet with
cheers when Harrison was introduced by the chairman. The
most striking passages of his speech were those in which he
demanded that Congress make lynching a Federal crime and
take the Negro’s life under national protection, and declared that
since lynching was murder and a violation of Federal and State
laws, it was incumbent upon the Negroes themselves to maintain
the majesty of the law and put down the law-breakers by organizing 
all over the South to defend their own lives whenever their
right to live was invaded by mobs which the local authorities
were too weak or unwilling to suppress.

The meeting was also addressed by Mr. J. C. Thomas, Jr., a
young Negro lawyer, who pointed out the weakness and subserviency 
of the old-time political leaders and insisted that
Negroes stop begging for charity in the matter of their legal
rights and demand justice instead.

Mr. Marcus Garvey, president of the Jamaica Improvement
Association, was next introduced by Mr. Harrison. He spoke
in enthusiastic approval of the new movement and pledged it his
hearty support.

After the Rev. Dr. Cooper, the pastor of Bethel, had addressed
the meeting, the following resolutions were adopted and a petition
to Congress was prepared and circulated. In addition the
meeting sent a telegram to the Jews of Russia, congratulating
them upon the acquisition of full political and civil rights and
expressing the hope that the United States might soon follow
the democratic example of Russia.

### Resolutions Passed at the Liberty League Meeting

Two thousand Negro-Americans assembled in mass-meeting
at Bethel A.M.E. Church to protest against lynching in the
land of liberty, and disfranchisement in the home of democracy
have, after due deliberation, adopted the following resolutions
and make them known to the world at large in the earnest hope
that whenever the world shall be made safe for democracy our
corner of that world will not be forgotten.

*We believe that this world war will and must result in a
larger measure of democracy for the peoples engaged therein&mdash;whatever 
may be the secret ambitions of their several rulers.*

*We therefore ask, first, that when the war shall be ended and
the council of peace shall meet to secure to every people the
right to rule their own ancestral lands free from the domination
of tyrants, domestic and foreign, the similar rights of the
250,000,000 Negroes of Africa be conceded. Not to concede them
this is to lay the foundation for more wars in the future and to
saddle the new democracies with the burden of a militarism
greater than that under which the world now groans.*

Secondly, we, as Negro-Americans who have poured out our
blood freely in every war of the Republic, and upheld her flag
with undivided loyalty, demand that since we have shared to the
full measure of manhood in bearing the burdens of democracy we
should also share in the rights and privileges of that democracy.

And we believe that the present time, when the hearts of ninety
millions of our white fellow-citizens are aflame with the passionate 
ardor of democracy which has carried them into the greatest
war of the age with the sole purpose of suppressing autocracy in
Europe, is the best time to appeal to them to give to twelve
millions of us the elementary rights of democracy at home.

For democracy, like charity, begins at home, and we find it
hard to endure without murmur and with the acquiescence of our
government the awful evils of lynching, which is a denial of the
right to life; of segregation, Jim Crowism and peonage, which
are a denial of the right to liberty; and disfranchisement, which
is a denial of justice and democracy.

And since Imperial Russia, formerly the most tyrannous government 
in Europe, has been transformed into Republican Russia,
whereby millions of political serfs have been lifted to the level of
citizenship rights; since England is offering the meed of political
manhood to the hitherto oppressed Irish and the down-trodden
Hindu; and since these things have helped to make good the
democratic assertions of these countries of the old world now
engaged in war;

Therefore, be it resolved:

That we, the Negro people of the first republic of the New
World, ask all true friends of democracy in this country to help
us to win these same precious rights for ourselves and our
children.

That we invite the government’s attention to the great danger
which threatens democracy through the continued violation of the
13th, 14th and 15th amendments, which is a denial of justice and
the existence of mob-law for Negroes from Florida to New
York;

That we intend to protest and to agitate by every legal means
until we win these rights from the hands of our government and
induce it to protect democracy from these dangers, and square
the deeds of our nation with its declarations;

That we create adequate instruments for securing these ends
and make our voice heard and heeded in the councils of our
country, and

That copies of these resolutions be forwarded to the Congress
of the United States and to such other public bodies as shall seem
proper to us.

### The Liberty League’s Petition to the House of Representatives of the United States, July 4, 1917

We, the Negro people of the United States, loyal to our country in every respect, and obedient to her laws, respectfully petition
your honorable body for a redress of the specific grievances and
flagrant violations of your own laws as set forth in this statement.
We beg to call your attention to the discrepancy which exists
between the public profession of the government that we are
lavishing our resources of men and money in this war in order
to make the world safe for democracy, and the just as public
performances of lynching-bees, Jim-crowism and disfranchisement 
in which our common country abounds.

We should like to believe in our government’s professions of
democracy, but find it hard to do so in the presence of the facts;
and we judge that millions of other people outside of the country
will find it just as hard.

Desirous, therefore, of squaring our country’s profession with
her performance, that she may not appear morally contemptible
in the eyes of friends and foes alike, we, the Negro people of
the United States, who have never been guilty of any disloyalty
or treason to our government, demand that the nation shall justify
to the world her assertions of democracy by setting free the millions 
of Negroes in the South from political and civil slavery
through the enactment of laws which will either take the Negroes
under the direct protection of the U. S. Congress by making
lynching a Federal crime, or (by legislative mandate) compelling
the several States which now deprive the Negroes of their right
to self-government, to give them the suffrage as Russia has done
for her Jews. W ask his in the name of the American declaration 
that the world shall be made safe for democracy and fervently 
pray that your honorable body will not go back upon
democracy.
