## INTRODUCTORY

The Great War of 1914&ndash;1918 has served to liberate many new ideas undreamt of by those who rushed
humanity into that bath of blood. During that war the
idea of democracy was widely advertised, especially in
the English-speaking world; mainly as a convenient
camouflage behind which competing imperialists masked
their sordid aims. Even the dullest can now see that those
who so loudly proclaimed and formulated the new democratic 
demands never had the slightest intention of
extending either the limits or the applications of “democracy.” 
Ireland and India, Egypt and Russia are still the
Ithuriel’s spear of the great democratic pretence. The
flamboyant advertising of “democracy” has returned to
plague the inventors; for the subject populations who
contributed their millions in men and billions in treasure
for the realization of the ideal which was flaunted before
their eyes are now clamoring for their share of it. They
are demanding that those who advertised democracy shall
now make good. This is the main root of that great
unrest which is now troubling the decrepit statesmanship
of Europe and America. But the rigid lines of the old
regime will not permit the granting of these new demands.
Hence the new war against democracy which expresses
itself in the clever but futile attempt to outlaw the
demands for fuller freedom as “sedition” and “Bolshevism.”

The most serious aspect of this new situation is the
racial one. The white world has been playing with the
catch-words of democracy while ruthlessly ruling an
overwhelming majority of black, brown and yellow peoples
 to whom these catchwords were never intended to
apply. But these many-colored millions have taken part
in the war “to make the world safe for democracy,” and
they are now insisting that democracy shall be made safe
for them. This, in plain English, their white overlords
do not intend to concede. “The undictated development
of all peoples” was, at best, intended “for white people
only.” Thus, white civilization is brought face to face
with a crisis out of which may easily grow military conflicts 
of tremendous scope and, more remotely, the
passing of international control out of the hands of a few
white nations.

The tenseness of this new situation has been reflected
here in the United States in the mental attitude of the
Negro people. They have developed new ideas of their
own place in the category of races and have evolved new
conceptions of their powers and destiny. These ideas have
quickened their race-consciousness and they are making
new demands on themselves, on their leaders and on the
white people in whose midst they live. These new demands 
apply to politics, domestic and international, to
education and culture, to commerce and industry.
It seems proper that the white people of America should
know what these demands are and should understand the
spirit in which they are being urged. Obviously, it is
not well that they should be misrepresented and lied
about. Futile fulminations about the spread of “Bolshevism” 
among Negroes by “agitators” will not help toward
an understanding of this new phenomenon. They can but
befog the issues and defer the dawning of a better day.
On the other hand, the Negro people will profit by a
clarified presentation of their own side of the case. It
is to meet this dual need that this little book is launched.
It is a compilation of some of the author’s contributions
to Negro journalism between 1917 and the present year
and consists of selected editorials, special articles and
reviews written for The Voice, The New Negro, and The
Negro World. I have selected for reproduction those
only which could fairly be considered as expositions of
the new point of view evolved during the Great War and
coming into prominence since the peace was signed. So
far, this point of view has not been fully presented-by
the Negro. White men, like Messrs. Sandburg and Seligman, 
have essayed to interpret it to the white world.
This little volume presents directly that which they would
interpret.

It may seem unusual to put into permanent form the
deliverances of this species of literature. But I venture
to think that, as literature, they will stand the test; and
I am willing to assume the risks. Besides, I feel that I
owe it to my people to preserve this cross-section of their
new-found soul. It was my privilege to assist in shaping
some of the forms of the new consciousness; and to
preserve for posterity a portion of its record has seemed
a duty which should not be shirked.

It was in 1916 that I first began to hammer out some of
the ideas which will be found in these pages. It was in
that year that I gave up my work as a lecturer and teacher
among white people to give myself exclusively to work
among my own people. In the summer of 1917, with the
financial aid of many poor but willing hearts I brought
out *The Voice*, the first Negro journal of the new dispensation, 
and, for some time, the only one. The Voice failed
in March, 1919; but in the meanwhile it had managed to
make an indelible impression. Many of the writings
reproduced here are taken from its files. The others are
from *The Negro World*, of which I assumed the joint
editorship in January of this year. A few appeared in
*The New Negro*, a monthly magazine which I edited for
a short time.

The account of the launching of the Liberty League is
given here in the first chapter because that meeting at
historic Bethel on June 12, 1917, and the labors of tongue
and pen out of which that meeting emerged were the
foundation for the mighty structures of racial propaganda 
which have been raised since then. This is a fact
not generally known because I have not hankered after
newspaper publicity.

It is hardly necessary to point out that the AFRICA
of the title is to be taken in its racial rather than in its
geographical sense.
