## CHAPTER VIII.<br>EDUCATION AND THE RACE.

[With most of the present sources of power controlled by the
white race it behooves my race as well as the other subject races
to learn the wisdom of the weak and to develop to the fullest
that organ whereby weakness has been able to overcome strength;
namely, the intellect. It is not with our teeth that we will tear
the white man out of our ancestral land. It isn’t with our jaws
that we can ring from his hard hands consideration and respect.
It must be done by the upper and not by the lower parts of our
heads. Therefore, I have insisted ever since my entry into the
arena of racial discussion that we Negroes must take to reading,
study and the development of intelligence as we have never done
before. In this respect we must pattern ourselves after the
Japanese who have gone to school to Europe but have never
used Europe’s education to make them the apes of Europe’s
culture. They have absorbed, adopted, transformed and utilized,
and we Negroes must do the same. The three editorials in
this chapter and the article which follows them were written to
indicate from time to time the duty of the transplanted African
in this respect.]

### Reading for Knowledge

Some time ago we wrote an editorial entitled “Read,
Read, Read!” We touch upon the same subject again,
because in our recent trip to Washington we found thousands 
of people who are eager to get in touch with the
stored-up knowledge which the books contain, but do not
know just where to turn for it. In New York the same
situation obtains, and no help is afforded by the papers
of our race.

The reason is that some of our newspaper editors don’t
read and don’t know beans themselves. James W. Johnson 
is one of the notable exceptions. We were cheered
up a good deal by noting his recent editorial advice to our
“leaders” to read Arthur Henderson’s “The Aims of
Labor.” But that was six months after the editor of
*The Voice* had been telling thousands of the “led” all
about it and about the British Labor Party and the Russian 
Bolsheviki in his outdoor talks in Harlem.

But there is no doubt that the New Negro is producing
a New Leadership and that this new leadership will be
based not upon the ignorance of the masses, but upon their
intelligence. The old leadership was possible partly because 
the masses were ignorant. Today the masses include 
educated laymen who have studied science, theology,
history and economics, not, perhaps in college but, nevertheless, 
deeply and down to date. These young men and
women are not going to follow fools and, indeed, are not
going to follow any one, blindly. They want a reason for
the things that they are asked to do and to respect. The
others, the so-called Common People, are beginning to
read and understand. As we sat in the great John Wesley
A.M.E. Zion Church in Washington one Sunday night,
and heard the cultured black minister speak to his people
on literature, science, history and sociology, and yet so
simply that even the dullest could catch the meat and
inspiration of his great ideas, we could not help saying
as we went out of the church: “Depend upon it, these
people will demand as much from their next minister.”
In fact our race will demand as much from all its leaders.
And they will demand no less for themselves.

So, with a glad heart, we reprint the following paragraphs 
from our earlier editorial trusting that our readers
everywhere may find them helpful:

As a people our bent for books is not encouraging. We
mostly read trash. And this is true not only of our rank
and file but even of our leaders. When we heard Kelly
Miller address the Sunrise Club of New York at a Broadway 
hotel two or three years ago, we were shocked at
the ignorance of modern science and modern thought
which his remarks displayed. His biology was of the
brand of Pliny who lived about eighteen hundred years
ago. For him Darwin and Spencer and Jacques Loeb
had never existed nor written. His ignorance of the
A.B.C.’s of astronomy and geology was pitiful.
If this is true of the leaders to whom our reading
masses look, what can we expect from those reading
masses? The masses must be taught to love good books.
But to love them they must first know them. The handicaps 
placed on us in America are too great to allow us to
ignore the help which we can get from that education
which we get out of school for ourselves&mdash;the only one
that is really worth while.

Without the New Knowledge the New Negro is no
better than the old. And this new knowledge will be
found in the books. Therefore, it would be well if
every Negro of the new model were to make up his (or her)
mind to get the essentials of modern science and modern
thought as they are set down in the books which may be
easily had. Don’t talk about Darwin and Spencer: read
them!

To help the good work along we append the following
list of books that are essential. When you *master* these
you will have a better “education” than is found in nine-tenths 
of the graduates of the average American college.

“Modern Science and Modern Thought,” by Samuel
Laing; “The Origin of Species” and “The Descent of
Man,” by Charles Darwin; “The Principles of Sociology”
and “First Principles,” by Herbert Spencer; “The Childhood 
of the World” and “The Childhood of Religion,”
by Edward Clodd; “Anthropology,” by E. B. Tylor (very
easy to read and a work of standard information on
Races, Culture and the origins of Religion, Art and Science); 
Buckle’s “History of Civilization”; Gibbon’s “Decline 
and Fall of the Roman Empire”; “The Martyrdom
of Man,” by Winwood Reade; the books on Africa by
Livingstone and Mungo Park, and “The Mind of Primitive 
Man,” by Franz Boas. &mdash;Sept., 1918.

### Education and the Race

In the dark days of Russia, when the iron heel of
Czarist despotism was heaviest on the necks of the people,
those who wished to rule decreed that the people should
remain ignorant. Loyalty to interests that were opposed
to theirs was the prevailing public sentiment of the masses.
In vain did the pioneers of freedom for the masses perish
under the knout and the rigors of Siberia. They sacrificed
to move the masses, but the masses, strong in their love
of liberty, lacked the head to guide the moving feet to
any successful issue. It was then that Leo Tolstoi and
the other intelligentsia began to carry knowledge to the
masses. Not only in the province of Tula, but in every
large city, young men of university experience would
assemble in secret classes of instruction, teaching them
to read, to write, to know, to think and to love knowledge.
Most of this work was underground at first. But it took.
Thousands of educated persons gave themselves to this
work-without pay: their only hope of reward lay in the
future effectiveness of an instructed mass movement.

What were the results? As knowledge spread, enthusiasm 
was backed by brains. The Russian revolution
began to be sure of itself. The workingmen of the cities
studied the thing that they were “up against,” gauged
their own weakness and strength as well as their opponents’. 
The despotism of the Czar could not provoke
them to a mass movement before they were ready and
had the means; and when at last they moved, they swept
not only the Czar’s regime but the whole exploiting system
upon which it stood into utter oblivion.

What does this mean to the Negro of the Western
world? It may mean much, or little: that depends on him.
If other men’s experiences have value for the New Negro
Manhood Movement it will seek now to profit by them
and to bottom the new fervor of faith in itself with the
solid support of knowledge. The chains snap from the
limbs of the young giant as he rises, stretches himself,
and sits up to take notice. But let him, for his future’s
sake, insist on taking notice. To drop the figure of speech,
we Negroes who have shown our *manhood* must back it
by our *mind*. This world, at present, is a white man’s
world&mdash;even in Africa. We, being what we are, want to
shake loose the chains of his control from our corner of
it. We must either accept his domination and our inferiority, 
or we must contend against it. But we go up to
win; and whether we carry on that contest with ballots,
bullets or business, we can not win from the white man
unless we know at least as much as the white man knows.
For, after all, knowledge *is* power.

But that isn’t all. What kind of knowledge is it that
enables white men to rule black men’s lands? Is it the
knowledge of Hebrew and Greek, philosophy or literature? 
It isn’t. It is the knowledge of explosives and
deadly compounds: that is chemistry. It is the knowledge 
which can build ships, bridges, railroads and factories:
that is engineering. It is the knowledge which
harnesses the visible and invisible forces of the earth and
air and water: that is science, modern science. And that
is what the New Negro must enlist upon his side. Let
us, like the Japanese, become a race of knowledge-getters,
preserving our racial soul, but digesting into it all that
we can glean or grasp, so that when Israel goes up out of
bondage he will be “skilled in all the learning of the
Egyptians” and competent to control his destiny.

Those who have knowledge must come down from
their Sinais and give it to the common people. Theirs is
the great duty to simplify and make clear, to light the
lamps of knowledge that the eyes of their race may see;
that the feet of their people may not stumble. This is the
task of the Talented Tenth.

To the masses of our people we say: Read! Get the
reading habit; spend your spare time not so much in
training the feet to dance, as in training the head to think.
And, at the very outset, draw the line between books of
opinion and books of information. Saturate your minds
with the latter and you will be forming your own opinions,
which will be worth ten times more to you than the
opinions of the greatest minds on earth. Go to school
whenever you can. If you can’t go in the day, go at
night. But remember always that the best college is that
on your bookshelf: the best education is that on the inside 
of your own head. For in this work-a-day world
people ask first, not “Where were you educated?” but
“What do you know?” and next, “What can you do with
it?” And if we of the Negro race can master modern
knowledge&mdash;the kind that counts&mdash;we will be able to win
for ourselves the priceless gifts of freedom and power,
and we will be able to hold them against the world.

### The Racial Roots of Culture

Education is the name which we give to that process
by which the ripened generation brings to bear upon the
rising generation the stored-up knowledge and experience 
of the past and present generations to fit it for the
business of life. If we are not to waste money and
energy, our educational systems should shape our youth
for what we intend them to become.

We Negroes, in a world in which we are the under dog,
must shape our youth for living in such a world. Shall
we shape them mentally to accept the status of under-dog
as their predestined lot? Or shall we shape them into
men and women fit for a free world? To do the former
needs nothing more than continuing as we are. To do the
latter is to shape their souls for continued conflict with a
theory and practice in which most of the white world that
surrounds them are at one.

The educational system in the United States and the
West Indies was shaped by white people for white youth,
and from their point of view, it fits their purpose well.
Into this system came the children of Negro parents when
chattel slavery was ended&mdash;and their relation to the problems 
of life was obviously different. The white boy and
girl draw exclusively from the stored-up knowledge and
experience of the past and present generations of white
people to fit them for the business of being dominant
whites in a world full of colored folk. The examples of
valor and virtue on which their minds are fed are exclusively 
white examples. What wonder, then, that each
generation comes to maturity with the idea imbedded in
its mind that only white men are valorous and fit to rule
and only white women are virtuous and entitled to
chivalry, respect and protection? What wonder that they
think, almost instinctively, that the Negro’s proper place,
nationally and internationally, is that of an inferior? It
is only what we should naturally expect.

But what seems to escape attention is the fact that the
Negro boy and girl, getting the same (though worse) instruction, 
also get from it the same notion of the Negro’s
place and part in life which the white children get. Is
it any wonder, then, that they so readily accept the status
of inferiors; that they tend to disparage themselves, and
think themselves worth while only to the extent to which
they look and act and think like the whites? They know
nothing of the stored-up knowledge and experience of
the past and present generations of Negroes in their ancestral 
lands, and conclude there is no such store of
knowledge and experience. They readily accept the assumption 
that Negroes have never been anything but
slaves and that they never had a glorious past as other
fallen peoples like the Greeks and Persians have. And
this despite the mass of collected testimony in the works
of Barth, Schweinfurth, Mary Kingsley, Lady Lugard,
Morel, Ludolphus, Blyden, Ellis, Ratzel, Kidd, Es-Saadi,
Casely Hayford and a host of others, Negro and white.

A large part of the blame for this deplorable condition 
must be put upon the Negro colleges like Howard,
Fisk, Livingstone and Lincoln in the United States, and
Codrington, Harrison and the Mico in the West Indies.
These are the institutions in which our cultural ideals
and educational systems are fashioned for the shaping of
the minds of the future generations of Negroes. It cannot 
be expected that it shall begin with the common
schools; for, in spite of logic, educational ideas and ideals
spread from above downwards. If we are ever to enter
into the confraternity of colored peoples it should seem
the duty of our Negro colleges to drop their silly smatterings 
of “little Latin and less Greek” and establish
modern courses in Hausa and Arabic, for these are the
living languages of millions of our brethern in modern
Africa. Courses in Negro history and the culture of
West African peoples, at least, should be given in every
college that claims to be an institution of learning for
Negroes. Surely an institution of learning for Negroes
should not fail to be also an institution of Negro learning. &mdash;The New Negro, Sept. 1919.

### The New Knowledge for the New Negro 

Quite a good deal of unnecessary dispute has been going on
these days among the guardians of the inner temple as to just
which form of worship is necessary at the shrine of the Goddess 
Knowledge. In plain English, the pundits seem to be at
odds in regard to the kind of education which the Negro should
have. Of course, it has long been known that the educational
experts of white America were at odds with ours on the same
subject; now, however, ours seem to be at odds among themselves.

The essence of the present conflict is not the easy distinction
between “lower” and “higher” education, which really has no
meaning in terms of educational principles, but it is rather “the
knowledge of things” versus “the knowledge of words.” The
same conflict has been waged in England from the days of Huxley’s 
youth to the later nineties when the London Board Schools
were recognized and set the present standard of efficiency for the
rest of England. The present form of the question is, “Shall
education consist of Latin and Greek, literature and metaphysics, 
r of modern science, modern languages and modern
thought?” The real essence of the question is whether we shall
train our children to grapple effectively with the problem of life
that lies before them, or to look longingly back upon the past
standards of life and thought and consider themselves a special
class because of this.

If education be, as we assert, a training for life, it must of
course have its roots in the past. But so has the art of the
blacksmith, the tailor, the carpenter, the bookbinder or the priest.
What the classicists really seek is the domination of the form,
method and aim of that training by the form, methods and aims
of an earlier age.

#### Classics, Clerics and Class Culture

Perhaps an explanation of that earlier training may serve to
give the real innerness of the classicists’ position so that ordinary
people may understand it better than the classicists themselves
seem to do. In the Middle Ages, the schools of Western Europe
and the subject matter of the education given in them were based
upon the Latin “disciplines.” Western Europe had no literature,
no learning, no science of its own. It was the church&mdash;particularly 
the monasteries&mdash;to which men had to go to get such
training as was obtainable in a barbarous age. This training was,
of course, given in the tongue of the church which was Latin, the
clerical language. The contact of medieval Europeans with the
dark-skinned Arabs added Greek and the knowledge of Greek
literature and philosophy to the earlier medieval discipline. Imbedded 
in this was the substance of science nurtured by the
Arabs and added to by them.

The ruling classes kept their children within the treadmill of
these two literatures and languages and it came to be thought
that this was the indispensable training for a gentleman. But:&mdash;

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza" lang="la">
<div class="verse leadingquote"><em>“Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis.”</em></div>
</div>
</div>

**

We are in a different age, an age in which the nation, not the
church, gives training to all children, and not merely to the children 
of aristocrats who will grow up to do nothing. The children
of the people must become the doers of all that is done in the
world of tomorrow, and they must be trained for this doing.
Today in England, not Oxford, the home of lost ideals, but such
institutions as the University of London, are the sources of that
training which gives England its physicians, surgeons, inventors,
business men and artists.

#### Classicists Ignorant of Latin and Greek

But the noise of the classicists may be rudely stopped by merely
pointing out the hollowness of their watch words. These persons
would have us believe that Latin and Greek are, in their eyes,
the backbone of any education that is worth while. Very well
then, let us take them at their word. I make the broad assertion
that not one in one thousand of them can read a page of Greek
or Latin that may be set before them. I offer to put under their
noses a page of Athenaeus or Horace (to say nothing of more
important classical authors) and if they should be able to
read and translate it at sight I shall be genuinely surprised.
Let the common reader who is a man of today make the test
with this little bit of Latin verse:

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza" lang="la">
<div class="verse leadingquote"><em>“Exegi momentum acre perennius</em></div>
<div class="verse"><em>Regalique situ pyramidum altius.”</em></div>
</div>
</div>


Let him ask some classicist to translate off-hand this common
school boy’s tag from a most popular author and note whether
they can place the author or translate the lines. Here is another:

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza" lang="la">
<div class="verse"><em>Per varios casus, per tot discrimina rerum,</em></div>
<div class="verse"><em>Tendimus in Latium.</em></div>
</div>
</div>

To speak in plain United States, when it comes to the showdown 
it will be found that those of us who argue in favor of
the modern discipline (in so far as we have any knowledge of
classical literature) know more about them than those whose
sole defence they are.

It is said by the classicists that a knowledge of Latin and Greek
is necessary to an adequate comprehension of the English language. 
But so is the knowledge of Sanscrit, Arabic, French and
Italian. And when it comes to facility and clearness of expression, 
it will be found that Huxley’s prose is superior to that
of Matthew Arnold, and Brisbane’s superior to that of any professor 
of the Latin language in Harvard or Yale. So much for
the ghost fighters. Requiescant in pace!

#### The Knowledge We Need

Now, what is the knowledge which the New Negro needs
most? He needs above all else a knowledge of the wider world
and of the long past. But that is history, modern and ancient:
History as written by Herodotus and John Bach McMaster;
sociology not as conceived by Giddings, but as presented by
Spencer and Ward, and anthropology as worked out by Boas
and Thomas. The Negro needs also the knowledge of the best
thought; but that is literature as conceived, not as a collection
of flowers from the tree of life, but as its garnered fruit. And,
finally, the Negro needs a knowledge of his own kind, concerning 
which we shall have something to say later, And the purposes 
of this knowledge? They are, to know our place in the
human processus, to strengthen our minds by contact with the
best and most useful thought-products evolved during the long
rise of man from anthropoid to scientist; to inspire our souls
and to lift our race industrially, commercially, intellectually to
the level of the best that there is in the world about us. For
*never until the Negro’s knowledge of nitrates and engineering,
of chemistry and agriculture, of history, science and business is
on a level, at least, with that of the whites, will the Negro be
able to measure arms successfully with them.*
