INTRODUCTORY
The (iront War of 1914-1918 has served to lllsernte
many new icleas increant or by those who rusteel
humanity into thint bathi of blooul. During that, war thic
iden of democracy was widely revertiseul, especially in
the English-speaking worldl; mainly as a convenient
ennuflage behine which competing imperinlists 'masked
their sordlid aims. kiven the dullest can now see that those
who so loudly proclaimed and formulated the new demo-
cratic demands never had the slightest intention of
extending cither the limits or thc applications of: "democ-
racy." Ireland and India, Egypt and Russia arc still the
Ithuriel's spear of the great democratic pretence. The
Mamboyant advertising of "democracy" has returned to
plaguc the inventors; for the subject populations who
contributed their millions in men and billions in treasure
for the realization of the islcal which was Naunted Icforc
their cyes are now clamoring for their share of it. They
arc demanding that those who advertised democracy shall
now mnke good. Thim in the minin root of that grent
unrest which is now troubling the decrepit statesmanship
of Europe and America. But the rigid lines of the old

reginic will not permit the granting of these new demands,
Hence the new war against clemxracy which expresses
itself in the clever heart furtile attempt to outlaw the
demands for fuller freedom as "sedition" and “Bol-
shevisını."
The mend serious aspect of this new situation is the
racial one. The white world has been playing with the
catch-words of democracy while ruthlessly ruling an
overwhelming majority of black, browni and yellow peo..
ples to whom these catchworily were never intendeel 10
apply. But these many-colored millions have taken part
in the war "to make the workel safe for democracy," and
they are now insisting that democracy shall be made'safe
for them. This, in plain English, their white overlords
llo not intend to concede. "The undictated developinent
of all peoples" was, at best, intended "for white people
only." Thus, white civilization is brought face to face
with a crisis out of which mny casily grow military con-
Micts of tremendous scope and, more remotely, the
passing of international control out of the hands of a few
white nations.
'The tenselices of this new situation has been reflected
here in the United States in the mental attitude of the
Negro people. They have developed new ideas of their
own place in the category of races and have evolved new
conceptions of their powers and clestiny. These ideas have
quickeneil their race-consciousness and they are making
new deninnels on themselves, on their lenders none on the
white people in whose midst they live. These new de-
mands apply to politics, domestic and internntional, to
education and culture, to commerce and industry,
It seems proper that the white people of America should
know what these demands are and should understand the
spirit in which they are being urged. Obviously, it is

On the other hand, the Negro people will profil ly a

is to meet this dual need that this little book is launched.
It is a compilation of some of the author's contributions
to Negro jeneronline between 1917 and the present year
and consists of selected editorials, special articles and
reviews written for The Voice, The New Negro, and The
Negro ll'orld. I have selected for reproduction those
only which could fairly be considered as expositions of
the new point of view evolved during the lireat War and
coming into prominence since the prince was signcı. So
far, this point of view has not been fully presented- by
the Negro. White men, like Messrs. Sanelburg and Selig.
man, have essayerl to interpret it to the white world.
This little volume presents directly that which they would
interpret.
It may seeni Unusual to prout into permanent form the
deliverances of this species of literature, but I venture
to think that, as literature, they will stand the test : and
I am willing to assume the risks. Besides, I feel that I
owe it to my people to preserve this cross-section of their
new-found soul. It was my privilege to assist in shaping
some of the forms of the new consciousness; and to
preserve for posterity a portion of its record lins noemed

It was in 1916 thint I first loegan to hammer out some of
the ideas which will be found in these pages. It was in
that year that I gave up my work as a lecturer and teacher

annig my own people. To the summer of 1917, with the
tinni miel of my pump bount willing Pacarte I brought
out the l'oice, the first Negro journal of the new dispen-
sation, and, for some time, the only one. The Voice failed
in March, 1919; but in the meanwhile it had managed to
make an indelible impression. Many of the writings
reproduced here are taken from its files. The others are
from The Negro Il'orld, of which I assumed the joint
cditorship in Jamury of this year. A few appeared in
The New Negro, a monthly magazine which I edited for
a short time.
The account of the launching of the Liberty League is
given here in the first chapter because that meeting at
historic Bethel on June 12, 1917, and the labors of tongue
and pen out of which that meeting emerged were the
foundation for the mighty structures of racial propa-
ganda which have been raised since then. This is a fact
innt generally known because I have not hankered after
newspaper publicity.
It is hardly necessary to point out that the AFRICA
of the title is to be taken in its racial rather than in its
geographical sense.

THE BEGINNINGS.
Launching the Liberty League
(From The l'oice of July 4, 1917.)
The Liberty League of Negro-Americans, which was recently
organized by the Negroes of New York, presents the most start-
ling program of any organization of Negroes in the country
today. This is nothing less than the demand that the Negroes
of the United States be given a chance to enthuse over democ-
racy for themscives in America before they are expected to
enthuse over democracy in Europe. The Leaguc is composed of
"Negro-Americans, loyal to their country in every respect, and
obcdicnt to her laws."
The League has an interesting history. It grow out of the labors
of Mr. Hubert H. Harrison, who has been on the lecture plat-
form for years and is well and favorably known to thousands
of white New Yorkers from Wall Street to Washington Heights,
Two years ago Mr. Harrison withdrew from an international
political organizatinn, and, a little more than a year ago, gave
up frcturing to white people, to devote himself to lecturing exclu.
sively among his own people. lle acquired so much influence
among them that when he issued the first call for a mass-mecting
"to protest against lynching in the land of liberty and disfran-
chisement in the home of democracy," although the call was
not advertised in any newspaper, the church in which the meet-
ing was held was packed from top to bottom. At this mane.
meeting. which was held at Bethel (hurch on June 12, the
organization was effected and funds were raised to sustain it and
to extend its work all over the country.
Harrison was subsequently elected its president, with Edgar

Grey and James Harris as secretary and treasurer, respectively.
At the close of this mass-meeting he hurriedly took the mid-
night train for Boston, where a call for a similar meeting had
been issued by W. Monroe Trotter, editor of The Boston (nar-
dian. While there he delivered an address in Fanueil Hall, the
cradle of American liberty, and told the Negries of Boston what
their brothers in New York had done and were doing. The
result was the linking tip of the New York and the Boston
organizations, and Ilarrison was clected chairman of a national

iration in the country to send delegates to a great race congress
which is to meet in Washington in September of October ind puit
their grievances before the country and Congress,
11 the New York mass-meeting money was subscribed for the
establishment of a newspaper to be known as The l'oice and to
serve as the medium of expression for the new demands and
aspirations of the new Negro. It was made clear that this "New
Negro Movement" represented breaking away of the Negro
masses from the grip of the old-time leaders---110ne of whom was
represented at the meeting. The audience rose to their feet with
cheers when Harrison was introduced by the chairman. The
most striking passages of his speech were those in which he
demanded that Congress make lynching a Federal crime and
take the Negro's life under national protection, and declared that
Nince lynching was murder and a violation of Federal and State
laws, it was incumbent upon the Negroe's themselves to maintain
the majesty of the law and put down the law-breakers hy organ-
izing all over the South to defend their own lives whenever their
right to live was invaded by mobs which the local authorities
were too weak or unwilling to suppress.
The meeting was also addressed by Mr. J. C. Thomas, Jr., a
your Negro lawyer, who pointed out the weakness and sub-
serviency of the old-time political leavlers and insisted that
Nrgroes stop begging for charity in the matter of their legal
rights and demand justice instead.
Mr. Marcus Garvey, president of the Jamaica Improvement
Association, was next introduced by Mr. Harrison. He spoke
in enthusiastic approval of the new movement and pledged it his
liearty support.

the meeting, the following resolutions were adopted and a petition
to Congress was prepared and circulated. In addition the
mecting sent a telegram to the Jews of Russia, congratulating
them upon the acquisition of full political and civil rights and
expressing the hope that the United States might soon follow
the democratic example of Russia.
Resolutions Passed at the Liberty League Meeting
'Two thousand Negro-Americans assembled in mass-meeting
at Bethel A. M. E. Church to protest against lynching in the
land of liberty and disfranchisement in the home of democracy
have, after duc deliberation, adopted the following resolutions
and make them known to the world at large in the earnest hope
that whenever the world shall be made sale for democracy our
corner of that world will not be forgotten.
We believe that this teorld near twill and must result in a
larger measure of democracy for the peoples ruraged therein ----
tchatever may be the secret ambitions of their several rulers.
We therefore ask, first, that when the war shall be ended and
the council of power shall mert to secure in curry people the
right to rule their open ancestral lands free from the domination
of tyrants, domestic and foreign, the similar rights of the
250,000,000 Negrocs of Africa be conceded. Not lo concede them
this is to lay the foundation for more wors in the future and to
saddle the new democracies with the burden of a militarism
greater than that under which the world now groans.
Secondly, we, as Negro-Americans who have poured out our
hlood freely in every war of the Republic, and upheld her fag
with undivided loyalty, demand that since we have shared to the
full measure of manhood in bearing the burdens of democracy we
should also share in the rights and privileges of that democracy.
And we believe that the present time, when the hearts of ninety
millions of our white fellow-citizens are aflame with the passion-
ate ardor of democracy which has carried them into the greatest
war of the age with the sole purpose of suppressing autocracy in
Europe, is the best time to appeal to them to give to twelve
millions of us the elementary rights of democracy at home.
For democracy, like charity, begins at home, and we find it
hard to endure without murmur and with the acquiescence of our

government the awful evils of lynching, which is a denial of the
right to lile; of segregation, Jim ('rowisin and peonage, which
are a denial of the right to liberty; and disfranchisement, which
is a denial of justice and democracy.
And since Imperial Russia, formerly the most tyrannous gov-
ernment in Europe, has been transformed into Republican Russia,
whereby millions of political serís have been lifted to the level of
citizenship rights ; since England is offering the meed of political
manhood to the hitherto oppressed Irish and the down-trodden
Hindu; and since tivese things have helped to make good the
democratic assertions of these countries of the old world now
engaged in war:
Therefore, be it resolved :
That we, the Negro people of the first republic of the New
World, ask all true friends of democracy in this country to help
us to win these same precious rights for ourselves and our
children,
That we invite the government's attention to the great danger
which threatens democracy through the continued violation of the
13th, 14th and 15th amendments, which is a denial of justice and
the existence of mob-law for Negroes froin Florida to New
York ;
That we intend to protest and to agitate by every legal means
uintil we win these rights from the hands of our government and
infuce it to protect deinocracy from these dangers, and square
the deeds of our nation with its declarations ;
That we create adequate instruments for securing these ends
and make our voice heard and hecded in the councils of our
country, and
That copies of these resolutions be forwarded to the Congress
of the United States and to such other public bodies as shall seem
proper to us.
The Liberty League's Petition to the House of Representatives
of the United Slales, July 4, 1917
We, the Negro people of the United States, loyal to our coun-
try in every respèci, and obedient to her laws, respectfully petition
your honorable body for a redress of the specific grievances and

llagrant violations of your own laws as set forth in this statement.
We beg to call your attention to the discrepancy which exists
between the public profession of the government that we are
lavishing our resources of men and money in this war in order
to make the world safe for democracy, and the just as public
performances of lynching-bees, Jim-crowism and disfranchise-
ment in which our common country abounds.
We should like to believe in our government's professions of
democracy, but find it hard to do so in the presence of the facts;
and we judge that millions of other people outside of the country
will find it just as hard.
Desirour, therefore, of squaring our country's profession with
her performance, that she may not appear morally contemptible
in the eyes of friends and focs alike, we, the Negro people of
the United States, who have never been guilty of any disloyalty
or treason to our government, demand that the nation shall justify
to the world her assertions of democracy by setting free the mil-
lions of Negrocs in the South from political and civil slavery
through the enactment of laws which will either take the Negrocs
under the direct protection of the U. S. Congress by making
lynching a Federal crime, or (by legislative mandate) compelling
the several States which now deprive the Negroes of their right
to self-governmert, to give them the suffrage as Russia has done
for her Jews. We ask this in the name of the American declara-
tion that the world shall be made safe for democracy and fer-
vently pray that your honorable body will not go back upon
democracy.

CHAPTER II.
DEMOCRACY AND RACE FRICTION.
The East St. Louis Horror
This nation is now at war to inake the world "safe for
clemocracy" hit this Negro's contention in the court or
public opinion is thrt until this nation itself is madle safe
for twelve million of its silhjects the Negrov, nt least, will
reitino 100 believe in the demantle assertions of the com-
try. The East St. Louis pogrom gives point to this
contention. Here, on the eve of the celebration of the
Nation's birthday of freedom and equality, the white
people, who are slenosticing the Ciermans is lluns and
harbarians, break loose in an orgy of improvoked and
villainous barbarism which neither Germans nor any other
civilizer people have ever cquallel.
Ilow can America holl wp its homes in hypocritical
horror at foreign barbarisai while the red blood of the
Negro is clinging to those hands; no long as the President
and Congress of the l'niteel States remain dumb) in the
presence of barbarities in their own land which would tip
thieir tongties with righteous indignation if they had been
slune in Belgium, Ireland or (inlicin?
And what are the Negroes to do? Are they expected
to re-echo with enthusiasm the patriotic protestations of
the boot-licking leaders whose pockets and positions
testify to the power of the white man's gold? Let there
be no mistake. Whatever the Negrocs may be compelled
hy law to do and sny, the resentment in their henrts will

not down. Unbeknown to the white people of this land
a temper is being devcloped among Negrocs with which
thic American people will inve to reckon.
At the present moment it takes this form: 11 while
meni arc to kill unoffending Negroes, Negroes must kill
white men in defense of their lives and property. This is
the lesson of the East St. Louis massacre.
The press reports declare that, “the troops who were
on duty during the most serious disturbances were or.
dered not to shoot." Thc civii and military authoritics
are evidently winking at the work of the mobs—horrible
as that was--and the Negroes of the city need not look
to them for protection. They must protect themsclvcs.
And even the United States Supreme Court concedes
them his right,
There is, in addition, a method of retallation which we
lirge upon them. It is one which will hit those white meni
who have the power to prevent lawlessness just where
they will feel it most, in the place where they keep their
consciences--the pocket-book. Let every Negro in East
St. Louis and the other cities where race rioting occurs
draw his money from the savings-hank and cither bank
It in the other cities or in the present anvings hank. The
only part of the news reports with which we are well
pleased in that which states that the property loss is
alrcady estimated at a million and a half of dollars,
Another reassuring fcature is the onc suppressed in
most of the news dispatches. We refer to the evidences
that thc Enst St. Louis Negroes organized themselves
during the riots and fought back under some kind of
Icadership. Wc Negrocs will never know, perlinps, how
many whites were killed by our enraged brothers in East
St. Louis. It isn't the news-policy of the white newspapers

llits editorial on "The Last St. Louis Ilorror" The
Voice said:
How can America hold up its hands in hypocritical horror at

to those hands? So long as the President and Congress of the
United States remain dumb in the presence of barbarities in their
own land which would tlp their tongines with righteous Indigna.
tion if they had been done in Belgium, Ireland or Galicia?
And what are the Negroes to do? Are they expected to re-echo
with enthusiasin the patriotie protestations of the boot lleking
leaders whose pockets and positions testify to the power of the
white man's gold? Let there be no mistake. Whatever the
Negrocs may be compelleil hy law to do and say, the fruentient
in their hearts will not down. I'whoknosem to the earhite people
of this land a temper is being developed among Negroes with
which the American people coill have to reckon.
Al the present moment il bukes this form 11 while men are in
will unofending Negroes, Negrocs must kill white men in defence
of their lives and property. This is the lesson of the East Si.
Louis massacre.
To this, the New York Age minkes reply in two ways.
Its editor, in an interview given to the Tribune, declarcs
that:
The representative Negro does not approve of radical social-
istic outbursts, such as calling tipon the Negroes to defend them-
selves against the whites.
And in its editorial of last week it insists that:

Now, although The Voice socks no quarrel with The
:Ime, whilfe fuferol in dietenit from this fringing, woll
sequious view which it champions. And we do this on
the ground that cringing has gone out of date, that The
ge's view does not now rrpresent any influential or
important section of Negro opinion. The group which
once held that view went to pieces when Dr. Washington
llied. The white papers in their new items of Innt week
gave instance after instance showing that Negroes not
only counsellcd self-defense, but actually practiced it.
(Anel The Ape, ly the way, wnw the only Negro paper In
New York City which excluded these items from its news
coliinins.) If the press reports are correct, then The
l'elee tule the simple truth when it wpoke of the now
temper which was being developed "unbeknown to the
white people of this Innil." And anns mitsirler might con-
clude that The Voice was a better friend to the white
people by letting them know this, than The Age was by
trying to lic about it.
But the controversy goes mich (leeper than the ques-
tion of candor and truthfulness. The Age and The Voice
join isstic on this couble question: Have Negrocs it right
to defend themselves against whites? Should they defend
themselves ? (And this, of course, means violence.) The
Voice answers, “Yes!" The Age answers "No!" Who is
to decide? Let us appeal to the courts. Every law-book

WHEN AFRICA AWAKES
and statute-bouk, every court in the civilized world and
in the l'nited States agree that every human being has the
legal as well as moral right to kill those who attack and
try to kill him. Then the question for The Age to decide,
is whether Negroes are human beings. To call our view
"socialistic" is to call the courts "socialistic," and displays
an amazing ignorance both of Socialism and of human
nature.
Before we leave this question, it is proper to consider
the near and remote consequences of the radical view.
The Aye says that unruly longues will alienate public
sympathy from the oppressed. Good God! Isn't it high
time to ask of what value is that kind of sympathy which
is ready to be alienated as soon as Negroes cease to be
"niggers" and insist on being men? Is that the sort of
sympathy on which The Age has thrived? Then we will
have none of it.
And, as to the remoter consequences: neither we nor
The Age has a lease on the future. We can but prophesy.
But intelligent people reach the unknown via the known,
and prophesy the future from the known past and present.
And we do know that no race or group of people past or
present ever won to the status of manhood among men
hy yielding up that right which even a singed cat will not
yield up--the right to defend their lives. If The Age
knows of any instance to the contrary in the history of the
past seven thousand years, let it mention that instancc.
But The Age may ask:
"What will self defense accomplish?" Let iis see first
what the absence of self-defense accomplishes. In its
news account of the St. Louis massacre, the Amsterdam
News shows that whenever the white mobs found a group
of Negroes vrganized and arnied, they turned back;

while The Aye itself had this significant and pathetic sen-
tence:
Since the massacre, which will go down in history alongside the
atrocities committed in Brussels and Rheims, a delegation of
Negroes has held a conference with Governor Lowden at Spring-
field, but the outcome of this meeling twill not bring back the lives
of those who, for no valid reason, were struck down and mur.
dered in cold blood.
Taking the two things together the answer seems clear
enough. When murder is cheap murder is indulged in
recklessly; when it is likcly to be costly it is not so readily
indulged in. Will The Age venture to deny this? No? Then
we sny, let Negroes help to make murier costly, for hy
so doing they will aid the officers of the city, state and
nation in instilling respect for law and order into the
minds of the worst and lowest elements of our American
cities. And we go further: We say that it is not alone
the brutality of the whites--it is also the cowardice of
Negroes and the lickspittle leadership of the last two
decades which, like The Age, told us to "take it all lying
down"-it is this which has been the main reason for our
"bein' so aisily lynched," as Mr. Dooley puts it.
Whatever The Age may say, Negroes will fight back as
they are already fighting back. And they will be more
highly regarded--as are the Irish--because of fighting
back.
We are aiming at the white man's respect--not at his
sympathy. We cannot win that respect by any con-
spicuous and contemptible cowardice; the only kind of
synpathy which we may win by that is the kind of
sympathy which men feel for a well-kicked dog which
cringes while they kick it.
"Rights are to be won by those who are ready and willing
to fight, if necessary, to have those rights respected."

Who says this? Thcodore Roosevelt. So does l'resident
Wilson. So does the U. S. Government. That is why ·
we went to war with Germany. Our country always acts
upon the best and highest principle and we Negroes have
just begun to see that our country is quite right. There-
fore, we are willing to follow its glorious example. That
is all.
The Negro and the Labor Unions
There are two kinds of labor unionism; the A. F. of L.
kind and the other kind. So far, the Negro has been
taught to think that all unionism was like the unionism
of the American Federation of Labor, and because of this
ignorance, his attitude toward organized labor has been
that of the scal. For this no member of the A. F. of L.
can blame the Negro. The policy of that organization
toward the Negro has been damnable. It has kept him
out of work and out of the unions as long as it could;
and when it could no longer do this it has taken him in,
t.ricked him, and discriminated against him.
On the other hand, the big capitalists who pay low
wages (from the son of Abraham Lincoln in the Pullman
Co. to Julius Rosenwald of the Sears Roebuck Co.)
have been rather friendly to the Negro. They have given
their money to help him build Y. M. C. A.'s and schools
of a certain type. They have given him community help
in Northern cities and have expended charity on him--
and on the newspapers and parsons who taught him.
Small wonder, then, that the Negro people are anti-union.
Labor unions were created by white working men that
they might bring the pressure of many to bear upon the
greedy employer and make him give higher wages and
better living conditions to the laborer. When they, in

Ilirn, become so grccely that they keep out the majority
of working people, by high ducs anel initiation fees, they
no longer represent the interests of the laboring class.
They stand in the way of this class's advancement ---and
they must go. They must leave the way cicar for the 20th
century type of unionism which says: "To leave a single
worker out is to leave something for the boss to use
against us. Therefore we must organize in One Big
Union of all the working-class." This is the type of
unionismi which organized, in 1911, 18,000 white and
14,000 black timber workers in Louisiana. This is the
I. W. W. type of unionism, and the employers use their
newspapers to make the public believe that it stands for
anarchy, violence, law-breaking and atheism, because they
know that if it succeeds it will break them.
This type of unionism wants Negrocs--not because its
promoters love Negrocs—but because they realize that
they cannot win if any of the working class is Icît out;
and after winning they cannot go back on them because
they could be used as scabs to break the unions.
The A. F. of L., which claims a part of the responsibil-
ity for the East St. Louis outrage, is playing with fire.
The American Negro may join hands with the American
capitalist and scab them out of existence. And the editor
of The Voice calls upon Negroes to do this. We have
stood the American Federation of Labor just about long
enough. Join hands with the capitalists and scab them
out of existence-not in the name of scabbery, but in the
name of a real organization of labor. Form your own
unions (the A. C. E. is already in the field) and make a
truce with your capitalist enemy until you get rid of this
traitor to the cause of labor. Offer your labor to capital-
ism if it will agree to protect you in your right to labor
and see that it does. Then get rid of the A. F. of L.

Lynching: Its Cause and Cure
Last week we had exccasion to comment on the resigna-
tion of Mr. John R. Shillacly from the secretaryship of
the N.. A. A. C.1'. Mr. Shillady's statemeiit accompany.
ing his resignation contains these significant words :-
"I am less confident than heretofore of the speedly stic-
cess of the association's full program and of the proba-
hility of overcoming within a reasonable period the forces
opposed to Negro quality loy the means and methods
which are within the association's power to employ."
That the N. A.N.C.P. is not likely to affect the lynch-
ings in this land can be seen with half an eye by any one
who will note that Governor J. A. Burnquist of Minne-
sota "is also president of the St. l'aul branch of the asso-
ciation and one of the staunch supporters of its work";
that the Minnesota lynching of last week was one of the
most cynically brutal that has occurred North or South in
the Inst ten years, and that the association has offered

and is offering to give the Governor all the assistance
possible.
In most of the other cases of lynchings it is assumed
that all the officials were in collusion with the forces of
violence, or were at any rate in acquicscence. In the pre--
ent case, however, the Governor of the State is himseli a
high officer of the association. Yet we venture 10
prophesy that no more will be done in the case of the
Minnesota lynchings than in the case of lynchings further
south.
This leads us to a front face consideration of the
problem of lynching. Why do white.men lynch black incon
in America: We are not dealing here with the original
historical cause; nor even with its present social applicar-
tion. We are considering merely the officient caust.
White men lynch black men or any other men boccaisse
those men's lives are improtected eitlier by the authorities
of the commonwealth or by the victims themselves.
White men lynch Nogroes in America because Negroes'
lives are chcap. So long as they so remain, so long will
lynching remain an evil to be talked about, written about,
petitioned against and slobbered over. Bit 1107 all the
slobber, the talk or the petitions are worth the time it
takes to indulge in them, so far as the saving of a single
Negro life is concerned.
What, then, is the cure. The cure follows from the
nature of the cause. Let Negrues determine that their
lives shall no longer be clicap; but that they will exact
for them as high a price as any other clement in the com.
munity under similar circumstances would exact. Let
them see to it that their lives are protected and dcfended.

of the casualties.
"Let Negroes: help to make murder costly, for hy so
doing they will aid the officers of the city, State. and
nation in instilling respect for law and order into the
minds of the worst and lowest elements of our American
cities." The law of every State says cxplicitly that killing
in dcfense of one's own life is strictly proper, legal and
justifiable. Therefore, if Negroes determine to defend
theniselves from the horrible outrage of lynching they
should have the support of every official and every citizen
who really believes in law and order and is determined to
make the law of the land stand as a living reality among
the people that made it.--July, 1920.

CHAPTER III.
THE NEGRO AND THE WAR.
[While the war lasted those of us who saw unpalatable truths
were compelled to do one of two things: either tell the truth as
we saw it and go to jail, or camouflage the truth that we had
to tell. The present writer told the truth for the most part, in so
far as it related to our race relations; but, in a few cases
camouflage was safer and more effective. That camouflage,
however, was never of that truckling quality which was accepted
by the average American editor to such a nauseating degree. I
was well aware that Woodrow Wilson's protestations of democ-
racy were lying protestations, consciously and deliberately
designed to deceive. What, then, was my duty in the face of
that fact? I chose to pretend that Woodrow Wilson meant
what he said, because by so doing I could safely hold up to con-
tempt and ridicule the undemocratic practices of his adminis-
tration and the actions of his white countrymen in regard to the
Negro. How this was done is shown in the first two cditorials
of the following chapter.)
Is Democracy Unpatriotic ?
The present administration is all right. But it has its
obstacles to success. As usual some of the worst of
these are its injudicious "friends." For instance, there
are the people who are trying their best to "queer" us
in the cyes of civilized Europe. These silly souls, when
Negroçs ask that the principle of "Justice in War Time”.

that this should not be; that Negroes should not want

prepared to maintain that lynching. Jim-crow and dis-

Why Is the Red Cross ?
The Kool Cross, or lieneva Inexciation, was the prod.
nict of a Swiss inficlel. Ile saw low cruel 10 man were
those who loved Coel most-the (liristians--anel, sollt of
his large humanity and loving kindness, he evolved an
organization which should bring the charity of service
10 lessen the lurid horrors of Christian battleticles.
A love that rose above the love of country the love
of human kind: this was the proud principle of the Red
Cross. Its nurses and its surgeons, stretcher-licarors and
assistants were supposed to bring relief to those who
were in pain, regardless of whether they were "friends"
or "enemies," Discrimination was a word which did not
exist for them: and it is not supposed to exist now cvcu
as against the wounded German aviator who has bomhed
a Red Cross hospital.
But, alack and alas! The splendid spirit of the Swiss
infidel is seemingly too high for Christian race-prejudice
to reach. Where he would not discriminate even against
enemies, the American branch of his international society
is discriminating against most loyal friends and willing
helpers—when they are Negroes. Up to date the Ameri-

can Red Cross Society, which receives government aid
and co-operation to help win the war, cannot cite the
name of a single Negro woman as a nurse. True, it says
that it has "enrolled" some. This we refuse to believe.
But even if that were true, a nurse "enrolled" cannot
save the life of any of our soldiers in France.
Thc Red Cross says that it wants to win the war.
What war? A white people's war, or America's and
the world's? It this were a white people's war, as some
seem to think, colored troops from Senegal, India, Egypt,
America and the West Indies would have been kept out
of it. But they were not, and we are driven to conclude
that this is a world war. Then why doesn't the Ameri-
can Red Cross meet it in the spirit of the President--of
world democracy? The cry goes up for nurses to save
the lives of soldiers; yet her are thousands of Negro
nurses whom the Red Cross won't accept. They must
want to give Europe a "rotten" opinion of American
democracy. For we may be sure that these things are
known in Europe --even as our lynchings are. And any-
one who would give Europe a "rotten" opinion of America
at this tinic is no friend of America.
The American Red Cross must be compelled to do
America's work in the spirit in which America has en-
tered the war. There need be no biting of tongues : it
must be compelled to forego Race Prejudice. If the
N. A. A. C. P. were truly what it pretends instead of a
National Association for the Advancement of Certain
People, it would put its high-class lawyers on the job and
bring the case into the United States courts. It would
charge the American Red Cross with disloyalty to the
war-aims of America. And if it does not (in spite of
the money which it got from the "silent" protest parade
and other 'moneys and legal talent at its disposal) then

it will merit the name which one of its own members
gave it—the National Association for the Acceptance of
Color Proscription. Get busy, "friends of the colored
people"! For we are not disposed to regard the camou-
flage of those who want nurses but do not want Negro
nurses in any other light than that of Bret Harte's Truth-
ful James :-
Which I wish to rcmark-
And my language is plain-
That for ways that are dark
And for tricks that are vain
The Heathen Chinee is peculiar:
Which the same I am free to maintain.
A Hint of "Our Repard"
The wisdom of our contemporary ancestors, having
decided that "We Negrocs must make every sacrifice to
help win the war and lay aside our just demands for the
present that we may win a shining place on the pages of
history," it must be cold comfort to learn that the first
after-the-war schoolbook of American history is out, that
it is written by Rcuben Gold Thwaites and Calvin Noyes
Kendall, that it devotes thirty-one pages to the war
and America's part in the war, and that not one word is
said of the Negro's part therein.
Of course, sensible men should fcel no surprise at this,
for they will realize how little the part played by the
Negro in thc Civil War is known by the millions white
school children who read the school historics. Yet, is
there is a spark of manhood left in the bosoms of our
"white men's niggers" who sold us out during the war

"But," we are told, "such person or persons can make
propaganda (in l'rance) which will force the l'eace ('on-
gress to consider American lynching, disfranchisement
and segregation.” Passing over the argument that such
person or persons would have to be able to write French
fuently, we wish to point out that the public sentiment of
even one French city takes more than a month to work up;
that the sentiment of one l'rench city can have but slight
weight with the Congress, and that, if it could rise to the
height of embarrassing them, the French authorities
would sternly put it down and banish the troublesome
persons. Karl Marx, l'rince Kropotkin, Malatesta and
Lenine are cases in point as showing what France has
done iinder less provoking circumstances.
Let us not try to play the part of silly fools. Lynch-
ing, disfranchisement and segregation are evils HERE:
and the place in which we must fight them is HERE. If
foolish would-be leaders have no plan to lay before our
people for the fighting HERE, in God's name, let them
say so, and stand out of the way! Let us gird up our
loins for the stern tasks which lie before us HERE and
address ourselves to them with courage and intelligence.
Africa and the Peace
"This war, disguise it how we may, is really being
fought over African questions." So said Sir Harry John-
ston, one of the foremost authorities on Africa, in the
London Sphere in June, 1917. We wonder if the Negroes
of the Western world quite realize what this means.
Wars are not fought for ideals but for lands whose popu-
lations can he put to work, for resources that can be
minted into millions, for trade that can be made to enrich
the privileged few. When King Leopold of Belgium

and Thomas Hortume kyan of New York joined hands
to exploit the wealth of the Congo they did it with oilee
phrases on their lips. They called that land of horrors
and of shame “The Congo FREE State!"
And, so, when Nations go to war, they never openly
declare what they WANT. They must camouflage their
sordid greed behind some sounding phrase like "freedom
of the seas," "self-determination,” “liberty" or "democ-
racy." But only the ignorant millions ever think that
those are the real objects of their bloody rivalries. When
the war is over, the mask is dropped, and then they seek
"how best to seramble at the shearers' feast." It is then
that they disclose their real war aims.
One of the most striking cases in point is the present
peace congress. Already l’resident Wilson has had to go
to look after democracy himself. Already responsible
heads of the Allied governments are making it known
that "freedom of the scas" means a benevolent naval
despotism maintained by them, and that “democracy"
means simply the transfer of Germany's African lands
to England and the others. Africa at the peace table con-
stitutes the real stakes which the winners will rake in.
We may read in headlines the startling itemi “Negroes
Ask For German Colonies," but Negroes of sense should
not be dcluded. They will not get them because they
have no battleships, no guns, no force, military or finan-
cial. They are not a Power.
Despite the pious piffic of nice old gentlemen like Pro-
fessor Kelly Miller, the King-word of modern nations is
POWER. It is only Sunday school "kids” and people of
child-races who take seriously such fables as that in the
"Band of Hope Review” when we were children that
"the secret of England's greatness is the Bible." The
secret of England's greatness (as well as of any other

great nation's) is not bibles but hayonets- havonets,
business and brains. As long as the white nations have
a preponderance of these, so long will they rule. Isk
Japan: she knows. And as long as the lands of Africa
can yield biilions of business, so long will white brains
use bayonets to keep them-as the British government
did last year in Nigeria.
Africa is turning over in her sleep, and this agitation
now going on among American Negroes for the liberation
of Africa is a healthy sign of her restlessness. But it is
no more than that. Africa's hands are tied, and, so tied,
she will be thrown upon the peace table. Let us study
how to unloose her bonds later. Instead of futile expecta-
tions from the doubtful generosity of white land-grab-
bers, let us American Negroes go to Africa, live among
the natives and LEARN WHAT THEY HAVE TO
TEACH US (for they have much to teach us). Let us
go there--not in the coastlands.----but in the interior, in
Nigeria and Nyassaland; let iis study engineering and
physics, chemistry and commerce, agriculture and indus-
try: let tis learn more of nitrates, of copper, rubber and
clectricity; so will we know why Belgium, France, Eng-
land and Germany want to be in Africa. Let us begin
hy studying the scientific works of the African explorers
and stop reading and believing the silly slush which
ignorant missionaries put into our heads about the alleged
degradation of our people in Africa. Let us learn to
know Africa and Africans so well that every educated
Negro will be able at a glance to put his hand on the
map of Africa and tell where to find the Jolofs, Ekois,
Mandingoes, Yorubas, Bechuanas or Basutos and can tell
soniething of their marriage customs, their property laws,

When heroic France was holding the Kaiser's legions
at bay her inflexible resolution found expression in the
phrase, “Ils ne passeront pas !"--they shall not pass! The
white statesmen who run our government in Washington
seem to have adopted the poilu's watchword in a less
worthy cause. The seventy-odd Negro "clelegates" to thc
l'eace Congress who have got themselves “elected" at
mass-meetings and concerts for the purpose of going
to France are not going--unless they can walk, swim, or
Ay. For the government will not issue passports for
them.
Of course, the government is not telling them so in
plain English. That wouldn't be like our government. It
merely makes them wait while their money melts away.
Day after day and week after week, they wearily wend
their way to the official Circumlocution Office where they

crniment ordered that ludicrous lackey, Mr. R. R. Moton,
to go for the same reason. In fact, the creation of sine-
etires for Mr. Scott and the other barnacles is due largely
to an linca y conscience. Hlow woull it look to have
Negroes telling all Europe that the land which is to make
the world "rife for democracy" is rotten with race-preju-
dice: Jimi-crows Negro officers on ships coming over
from l'rance and on trains run er government con-
Trol; condones lynching by silent acquiescence and refuses
to let its Negro heroes vote as citizens in that part of
the country in which nine-tenths of them live. This
wouldn't do at all.
Therefore: They shall not pass! And if, finally, the
'government, nettled by such criticisins, should lift the
han when the Peace Congress is practically over, the
Negroes of America may be seire that those permitted to
go will lie carefully hand-pickedl.
But what is the matter with America as a land for
pioneer work in planting emocracy? Are these Negro
cmigrés afraid to face the white men here in the Repub-
lican l'arty or any other and raise Hades until the Con-
stitution is enforced? Is cowarılice the real reason for
their running to l'rance to incork their mouths? It looks
very much like it. Ladies and gentlemen : don't run.
The fight is here, and here you will be compelled to face
it, or report to us the reason why.

in the latter part of 1865. The war had hardly been
declared officially at an eml when thic cowardly "crackers"
who couldn't lick thc Yankees began organizing to take
it out of the Negroes. They :vassed laws dcclaring that
any black man who couleln't sirow three lundroid dollars
should be declared at vagrant; that every vagrant should
be put 10 work in the chain-gring on the public works of
their cities; that three Negroes should not gather together
unless a white man was with them, and other such
methods were used as were found necessary to maintain
"white supremacy." When the national Congress met in
December, 1865, it looked upon these light diversions
with an unfriendly cyc and, noting that nothing short of
the re-cnslavcnicnt of the Negroes would satisfy the
"crackers,” it kept them out of Congress until they
would agree to do better. l'inding that they were stiff-
nccked, Congress passce the 14th and 15th amendmenis
and put the "cracker" states under military rule until they
accepted the amendments. The result wns that the Negro
got the ballot ns n protection from thic people who know
him best."
In the meanwhile, the Ku-Klux after rampaging around
under the leadership of that traitor, General Nathaniel B.
Forrest, was put down--for good, as it was thought.
Today, after the Negro has been stripped of the ballot's
protection by the connivance of white Republicans in
Washington and white Democrats at the South, the
Ku-Klux dares to raise its ugly head in its ancestral
state of Tennessce. This time they want to increase that
fine brand of democracy which every coward cditor knows
that Negroes were getting when they were bidding them
to be patriotic. The Ku-Klux means to shoot them into
submission and torture them into terror before they get

to showing their wounds and asking for the ballot as a
recompense.
In this crisis what have the Negro "leaders“ got to say
on their people's behalf? Where is Emmett Scott?
Where are Mr. Moton and Dr. Du Bois ? What will the
N. A. A. (°. L'. do besides writing frantic letters? We
fear that they can never rise above the level of appeals.
But suppose the common Negro in Tennessee decides to
take a hand in the game: Suppose he lets it be known
that for the life of every Negro soldier or civilian, two
"crackers" will dic? Suppose he lets theni know that it
will be as costly to kill Negroes as it would be to kill real
people? Then indeed the Ku-Klux would be met upon its
own ground. And why not?
All our laws, even in Tennessce, declare that lynching
and white-capping are crimes against the person. All our
laws declare that people singly or in groups have the right
to kill in defense of their lives. And if the Ku-Klux
prevents the officers of the law from enforcing that law,
then it is up to Negroes to help the officers hy enforcing
the law on their own account. Why shouldn't they do
it? Lead and steel, fire and poison are just as potent
against "crackers" as they were against Germans, and
democracy is as well worth fighting for in Tennessee as
ever it was on the plains of lirance. Not iintil the
Negroes of the south recognize this truth will anybody
else recognize it for them.

CHAPTER IV.
THE NEW POLITICS.
The New Politics for the New Negro
The world of the future will look upon the world of
today as an essentially new turning point in the path of
human progress. All over the world the spirit of demo-
cratic striving is making itself felt. The new issues have
brought forth new ideas of freedlom, politics, industry
and society at large. The new Negru living in this new
world is just as responsive to these new impulses as other
people are.
In the "good old «lays” it was quite easy to tell the
Negru to follow in the footsteps of those who had gone
before. The mere mention of the name Lincoln or the
Republican party was sufficient to secure his allegiance
to that party which had seen him stripped of all political
power and of civil rights without protest--effective or
otherwise.
Things are different now. The new Negro is demand-
ing elective representation in Baltimore, Chicago and
other places. He is demanding it in New York. The
pith of the present occasion is, that he is no longer beg-
ging or asking. He is demanding as a right that which
he is in position to enforcc.
In the presence of this new demand the old political
leaders are bewildered, and afraid; for the old idea of
Negro leadership by virtue of the white man's selection
has collapsed. The new Negro leader must be chosen by

his fellows --by those whose strivings he is supposed to
represent.
Any man today who aspires to lead the Negro 'race
must set squarely before his face the idea of "Race First”
Just as the white men of these and other lands are white
men before they are Christiaus, Anglo-Saxons or Repub-
licans ; so the Negroes of this and other lands are intent
tipon being Negroes before they are Christians, English-
men, or Republicans.
Sauce for the goose is salice for the gander. Charity
begins at home, and our first duty is to ourselves. It is
not what we wish but what we must, that we are con-
cerned with. The world, as it ought to be, is still for us,
as for others, the world that does not exist. The world
as it is, is the real world, and it is to that real world that
we address ourselves. Striving to be men, and finding 10
effective aid in government or in politics, the Negro of
the Western worle must follow the path of the Swadesha
movement of India and the Sinn Fein movement of
Ireland. The meaning of both these termis is "ourselves
first." This is the mental background of the new politics
of the New Negro, and we commend it to the considera-
tion of all the political parties. For it is upon this back-
ground that we will predicate such policies as shall seem
to lis necessary and desirable.
In the British Parliament the Irish Home Rule party
clubbed its full strength and devoted itself so exclusively
to the cause of l'rce Ireland that it virtually dictated for
a time the policies of Liberals and Conservatives alike.
The nicze Negro race in America will not achieve politi-
cal self-respect until it is in a posiiton to organise itself as
a politically independent party and follore the example,
of the Irish Home Rulers. This is what will happen in
American politics.--September, 1917.

The Drifl in Politics
The Negroes of America—those of them who think-
are suspicious of everything that comes from the white
people of America. They have seen that every movement
for the extension of democracy here has broken down as
soon as it reached the color line. Political democracy
cleclared that “all men are crcated cqual," micant only all
white men; the Christian church found that the brother-
hood of man did not include God's bastard children; the
public school system proclaimed that the school house.

and the civil service says that Negroes must keep their
place-at the bottom. So that they can hardly be blamed
for looking askance at any new gospel of freedom. Free-
dom to them has been like one of
"thosc juggling fiends
That palter with us in a double sense ;
That keep the word of promise to our ear,
And break it to our hope."
In this connection, somc cxplanation of the former
political solidarity of those Negroes who were voters may
be of service. Up to six years ago the one great obstacle
to the political progress of the colored people was their
sheep-like allegiance to the Republican party. They were .
taught to believe that God had raised up a peculiar race
of men called Republicans who had loved the slaves so
tenderly that they had taken guns in their hands and
rushed on the ranks of the southern slaveholders to free
the slaves; that this race of men was still in existence.

showing their great love for Negroes by appointing from
six to sixteen ncar-Negrocs to soft political snaps. Today
that great political superstition is falling to pieces before
the advance of intelligence among Negroes. They begin
to realize that they werc sold out by the Republican party
in 1876; that in the last twenty-five years lynchings have
increased, disfranchisement has spread all over the South
and "Jim-erow" cars run even into the national capitol---
with the continuing consent of a Republican Congress,
a Republican Supreme Court and Republican President.
Ever since the Brownsville affair, but more clearly since
Taft declared and put in force the policy of pushing out
the few near-Negro officeholders, the rank and file have
come to see that the Republican party is a great big shani.
Many went over to the Democratic party because, as the
Amsterdam News puts it. “They had nowhere else to go."
Twenty years ago the colored men who joined that party
were ostracized as scalawags and crooks. But today, the
defection to the Democrats of such men as Bishop
Walters, Wood, Morton, Carr and Langston--whose
tincle was a colored Republican Congressman from Vir-
ginia--has made the colored democracy respectable and
given quite a tone to political heterdoxy.
All this loosens the bonds of their allegiance and breaks
the bigotry of the last forty years. But of this change in
their political view-point the white world knows nothing
The two leading Negro newspapers are subsidized by the
same political pirates who own the title-decds to the
handful of hirelings holling office in the name of the
Negro race. One of these papers is an organ of Mr.

is, it must be bought on the installment plan, and both of

Today the politician who wants the support of the
Negro voter will have to give something more than pie-
crust pronvises. The old professional "friend to the

representation, and we are out to throw our votes to any
party which gives us this, and withhold them from any
party which refuses to give it. No longer will we follow

that no leader so controlled can oppose such party in

demanding or threatening. In all these cases his dependi-
ence is on the good will, sense of justice or gratitude of
the other fellow. And in none of these cases is the
political reaction of the other fellow within the control
of the Negro,
But a change for the better is approaching. Four years
ngo, the present writer was properunding in lectures, in-
doors and outdoors, the thesis that the Negro people of
America would never amount to anything much politically
until they should see fit to imitate the Irish of Britain and
to organize themselves into a political party of their own
whose leaders, on the basis of this large collective vote,
coull "hold up" Republicans, Democrats, Socialists or
any other political group of American whites. As in
many other cases, we have lived to see time ripen the
fruits of our own thought for some one else to pluck.
Here is the editor of the Challenge making a campaign
along these yery lines, llis version of the idea takes the
form of advocating the nomination of a Negro for the
l'residency of the United States. In this form we haven't
the slightest doubt that this idea will meet with a great
deal of ridicule and contempt. Nevertheless, we venture
to prophesy that, whether in the hands of Mr. Bridges or
another, it will come to be ultimately accepted as one of
the finest contributions to Negro statesmanship.
No one pretends, of course, that the votes of Negroes
can clect a Negro to the high office of President of the

United States. Nor wordel any one expect that the votes
of white people will be forthcoming to assist them in such
a project. The only way in which it Negro could be
clected President of the United States would be by virtue
of the voters not knowing that the particular candidate
was of Negro ancestry. This, we believe, has already
happence within the memory of living men. But, the
cssential intent of this new plan is to furnish a focussing-
point around which the ballots of the Negro voters may
be concentrated for the realization of racial demands for
justice and quality of opportunity and treatment. It
would be carrying “Racc First" with a vengeance into the
arena of domestic politics. It woull take the Negro voter
out of the ranks of the Republican, Democratic and
Socialist parties and workel enable their leaders to tralle
the votes of their followers, openly and above-board, for
those things for, which masses of men largely exchange
their votes.
Mr. Bridges will find that the idea of a Negro candidato
for l'resident presupposes the creation of a purely Negro
party and tipon that prerequisite he will find himself
compelled to concentrate. Doubtless, most of the political
wise-acres of the Negro racc will argue that the idea is
impossible because it antagonizes the white politicians
of the various parties. They will close their eyes to the
inct that politics implies antagonism and a conflict of
interest. They will fail to see that the only things which
count with politicians are votes, and that, just as onc
white man will cheerfully cut another white man's thront
to get the dollars which a black man has, so will onc
white politician or party cut another one's throat polit-
ically to get the votes which black men may cast at the
polls. But these considerations will finally carry the day.

is lic can hy the 11se of force, linancial, political or other,
win, seize or maintain in the feetle of opposition that
position whiclı he finds necessary to his own security and
salvation. And we Negroe's may as well make up our
minds now that we can't depend upon the good-will of
white men in anything or at any point where our interests
and theirs conflict. Disguise it as we may, in business,
politics, education or other departments of life, we as
Neyroes are compelled to fight for what we want to win
from the white world.
It is easy enougli for those colored men whose
psychology is shaped by their white inheritance to argue
the ethics of compromise and inter-racial co-operation.
But we whose brains are still unbastardized must face
the frank realities of this situation of racial conflict and
competition. Wherefore, it is well that we marshal our
furces to withstand and make head against the constant
racial pressure. Action and reaction are equal and
opposite. Where there is but slight pressure a slight
resistance will suffice. But where, as in our case, that
pressure is grinding and pitiless, the resistance that would
re-establish equal conditions of freedom must of necessity
be intense and radical. And it is this philosophy which
must furnish the motive for such a new and radical
departure as is implied in the joint idea of a Negro party
in American politics and a Negro candidate for the
Presidency of these United States.--June, 1920.

South it hasn't. This was not always su. There was in
time whicn thc Negro voters of the South sent in to con-
press a thin but steady stream of black men who repre:
sented their political interests directly. Due to the mis.
adventures of the reconstruction period, this stream was
shut off until at the beginning of this century George
White, of North Carolina, was the sole and last repre-
sentative of the black man with a ballot in the South.
This result was due largely to the characteristic
stúpidity of the Negro voter. He was a Republican, he
was. Jle would do anything with his ballot for Abraham
Lincoin---who was dead but not a thing for himself and
his family, who were all alive and kicking. For this tlie
Republican party loved him so much that it permitted the
Democrats to disfranchise him while it controlled Con-
gress and the courts, the army and navy, and all the
machinery of law-enforcement in the United States. With
its continuing consent, Jim-crowism, disfranchisement,
scgregation and lynching spread abroad over the land.
The end of it all was the recluction of the Negro in the
South to the position of a political serf, an industrial
pcon and a social outcast.
Recently there has been developed in the souls of black
folk a new manhood dedicated to the proposition that, if
all Americans arc cqual in the matter of baring their
breasts to forcign bayonets, then all Americans must, boy
their own efforts, be made cqual in balloting for Presi.
dents and other officers of the government. This principle
is compelling the Republican party in certain localities to
consider the necessity of nominating Negrocs on its local
electoral tickets. Yet the old attitude of that party on
the political rights of Negroes remains substantially the
same.
Here, for instance, is the Chicago convention, at which

the Negro delegates were lined up to do their duty by the
party. Of course, these delegates had to deal collectively
with the white leaders. This was to their mutual advan-
tage. But the odd feature of the entire affair was this,
that, Il'herous the Negro people in the South are not
free to cost their quotes, it was precisely from these rote-
less arcus that the national Republican Iraders selected
the political spokesmen for the voting Negrocs of the
North. Men who will not vote at the coming election and
inen who, like Rosene Simmons, never cast a vote in their
lives were the accrediter representatives in whose hands
lay ile destiny of a million Negro voters.
But there neeel he no fear that this insult will
annoy the black brother in the Republican ranks. A
Negro Republican generally runs the rhinoceros and the
clephant a close third. In plain English, the average
Negro Republican is too stupid to see and 100 meck to
mind. Then, too, here is l'ate's retribution for the black
man in the North who has never carcil enough to fight
(the Republican party) for the political freedom of his
brother in the South, but left him to rot under poll-tox
laws and grandfather clauses. The Northern white
Teutowrats, for letting their Southern borethren riu riot
through the constitution, must pay the penalty of being
leil into the ditch by the most ignorant, siupid and vicious
portion of their party. Even so, the Northern Negro
Republican, for letting liis Southern brother remain a
politiciil ragamuflin, must now stomach the insult of this
same raganuftin (lictating the destiny of the freer Negrocs

The Grand Old Parly
In the carly days of 1861, when the Southern Senators
anl Representatives were relinquishing their seats in the
United States Congress and hurling cartels of deliant
explanation broarlcast, the Republican party in Congress,
under the leadership of Charles Francis Adanys of Mas-
sachusetts, organized a joint committee made up of
thirteen members of the Scnate and thirty-three members
of the llouse to make overtures to the secoding Southern-
crs. The result of this friendly gesture was a proposeel
thirteenth amendment, which, if the Southerncrs had not
been so obstinate, would have bridged the chasmı. For
this amendment proposed to make the slavery of the
black man in America eternal and incscapable. It pro-
vided that no amendment to the Constitution, or any other
proposition affecting slavery in any way, could ever be
legally presented tipon the floor of Congress unless its
mover had sccured the previous consent of every Scnator :
and Representative from the slave-holdiny Siates. It put
tecth into the liugitive Slave Law and absolutely gave the
Negro over into the keeping of his oppressors.
Most Negro Americans (and white ones, too) think it
fashionable to nmintain the most fervirl faith and deepest
ignorance about points in their national history of which
they should be informed. We therefore submit that these
facts are open and notorious to those who know Amere
ican history. The record will be found slimly and shinnie.

Negroes today who are striving secretly, when they dare
not do so openly, to perpetuate the bonds of serfdom
'which bind the Negro Americans to the Republican party.
This bond of seridom, this debt of gratitude, is supposed
to hinge on the love which Horaham Lincoln and his party
are supposed to have burne towards the Negro; and the
object of this appeal to the historical record is to show
that that record denionstrates that if the Negro owes any
debt to the Republican party it is a delit of execration and
of punishment rather than one of gratitude.
It is an astounding fact that in his First Inaugural
Address Abraham Lincoln gave his explicit approval to
the substance of the Crittenden resolutions which the
joint committee referred to above had collectively taken

government which the election of Abri am Lincoln had

('lows, and others who took part in this raid upon the
resources of a great but stupid people.
But the Civil War phase of the Republican party's
treason to the Negro is not the only outstanding one, as
was shown by the late General Treinaine in his "Sectional-
ismi Unmasked." Not only was General (irant clected in
1808 by the newly created Negro vote, as the official
records prove, but his re-election in 1872 was effected by
the same means. So was the election of Rutherford B.
Hayes in 1876. Yet when the election of Hayes had been
taken before the overwhelmingly Republican Congress
this shameless party made a deal whereby, in order to
pacify the white "crackers" of the South, the Negro was
given over into the hands of the triumphant Ku-Klux; the
soldiers who protected their access to the ballot. box in
the worst southern states were withdrawn, while the
"crackers" agreed as the price of this favor to withdraw
their opposition to the election of Hayes. For this there
exists ample proof which will be presented upon the chal-
lenge of any politician or editor. As a Republican Senator
from New England shamelessly said, it was a matter of
"Root, hog, or die” for the helpless Negro whose ballots
had buttressed the Republican party's temple of graft and
corruption. So was reconstruction settled against the
Negro by the aid and abetting of the Republican party.
And since that time lynching, disfranchisement and
segregation have grown with the Republican party in
continuous control of the government from 1861 to 1920
--with the exception of eight years of Woodrow Wilson
and eight years of Grover Cleveland. With their con-
tinuing consent the South has been made solid, so that
at every Republican convention delegates who do not
represent a voting constituency but a grafting collection
of white postmasters and their Negro lackeys can turn

the scales of nomination in favor of any person whom
the central clique of the party, controlled as it lins always
been by Wall Street financiers, may fvise tipon a disgusted
people, as they have done in the case of Llarding. So
long as the South remains solidl, so long will the Repub-
lican delegates from the South consist of only this handiul
of hirelings; so long will they be amenable to the "lis-
cipline" which means the pressure of the jobs by which
they get their bread. Therefore the Republican leaders
will know that the solidarity of the South is their most
valuable asset; and they are least likely to do anything
that will break that solidarity. The Republican party's only
interest in the Negro is to get his vote for nothing; and
so long as Negro Republican leaders remain the con-
temptible grallers and political procurers that they are
at present, so long will it get Negro votes for nothing.
Through it all the Republican party remains the most
corrupt influence among Negro Americans. It buys up
by jobs, appointments and gifts those Negroes who in
politics should be the free and independent spokesmien of
Negro Americans. But worse than this is its private work
in which it secretly subsidizes men who pose before the
public as independent radicals. These intellectual pimps
draw private supplementary incomes from the Republican
party to sell out the influence of any movement, church
or newspaper with which they are connected. Of the
enormity of this mode of procedure and the extent to
which it saps the very springs of Negro integrity the
average Negro knows nothing. Its blighting, Waleſul in-
fluence is known only to those who have trained cars to

CHAPTER V.
THE PROBLEMS OF LEADERSHIP.
Tin all the tangles of our awakening race consciousness there
are perhaps none more knotty than the tangles relating to leader-
ship. Leadership among Negro Americans, as among other peo-
ple, mcans the direction of a group's activities, whether by
precept, example or compulsion. But, in our case, there is in-
volved a strikingly new element. Should the leading of our
group in any sense be the product of our group's consciousness
or of a consciousness originating from outside that group? What
the new Negro thinks on the problem of "outside interference"
in the leadership of his group is expressed in the first and sixth
editorials of this chapter, one of which appeared in The Voice
and the other in The Vegro Il'orld.
"A Tender l'oint" formulates one part of the problem of
leadership which is seldom touched upon by Negro Americans
who characteristically avoid any public presentation of a thing
about which they will talk interminably in private ; namely, the
claim advanced, explicitly and implicitly, by Negroids of mixed
blood to be considered the natural leaders of Negro activities on
the ground of some alleged "superiority" inherent in their white
blood.
"The Descent of Du Bois" was written at the request of Major
Loving of the Intelligence Department of the Army at the time
when Dr. Du Bois, the editor of The Crisis, was being preened
for a desk captaincy at Washington. Major Loving solicited a
summary of the situation from me as one of those "radicals"
qualified to furnishi such a summary. This he incorporated in his
report to his superiors in Washington, and this I published a week
later in The Voice of July 25, 1918, as an editorial without
changing a single word. I was informed by Major Loving that
this editorial was onc of the main causes of the government's
change of intention as regards the Du Bois captaincy. Since
that time Dr. Du Bois's white friends have been ſervidly ignor-

ing the occurrence and the consequent collapse of his leadership.
"When the Blind Lead" was written as a reminder to the souls
of black folks that "while it is as easy as eggs for a leader to
fall off the fence, it is devilishly difficult to boost him up again."
“Just Crabs" was a delightful inspiration in the course of
defending, not Mr. Garvey personally, but the principles of the
New Negro Manhood Movement, a portion of which had been
incorporated by him and his followers ni thc U. N. I. A. and
A. C. L. It was the opening gun of the defense, of which some
other salvos were given in the serial satire of The Crab Barrel
which I have been kind enough to omit from this record. This
controversy also gave rise to the three first editorials of
chapter 6.)
Our Professional "Friends"
This country of ours has produced many curious lines
of endeavor, not the least curious of which is the busincss
known as "being the Negro's friend." It was first invented
by politicians, but was taken up later by "good" men, six-
per-cent philanthropists, millionaire believers in "industrial
education," benevolent newspapers Ike the Evening Post,
and a host of smaller fry of the "superior racc." Just at
this time the business is being worked to death, and we
wish to contribute our mite toward the killing—by show-
ing what it nicans.
The first great "friend” of the Negro was the Southern
politician, Henry Clay, who, in the first half of the ninc-
leenth century organized the Anicrican Colonization
Society. This society befriended the "free men of color"
by raising funds to ship them away to Liberia, which was
accepted by many free Negrocs as a high proof of the
white man's "friendship." But Frederick Douglass.

to get rid of the free Negroes because, so long as they
continued to live here, their frecdom was an inducement
to the slaves to run away from slavery, and their accom-
plishments demonstrated to all white people that the
Negro (contrary to the claims of the slave-holders) was
capable of a higher human destiny than that of being chat-
tels--and this was helping to make American slavery
odious in the eyes of the civilized world.
Since that time the dismal farce of "friendship” has
been played many times, by politicians, millionaires and
their editorial adherents, who have been profuse in giving
good advice to the Negro people. They have advised themi
to "go slow," that. "Rome was not built in a day," and
that "half a loal is better than no bread," that "respect
could not be demanded," and, in a thousand different
ways have advised them that if they would only follow
the counsels of "the good white people" who really had
their interests at heart, instead of following their own
counsels (as the Irish and the Jews do), all would yet be
well. Many Negroes who have a wish-bone where their
back-bone ought to be have been doing this. It was as a
representative of this class that Mitchell's man, Mr. Fred
R. Moore, the editor of The Age, spoke, when in July he
gave utterance to the owlish reflection that,
The Negro race is afflicted with many individuals whosc wagging
tongues are apt to lead them into indiscrect utterances that reflect
upon the whole race.
The unruly tongues should not be
allowed to alienate public sympathy from the cause of the
oppressed.

It was as a fairly good representative of the class of
"good white friends of the colored people" that Miss Mary

of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, sent to The Voice the following bossy
and dictatorial note :
My ar Mr. Harrison,
I don't see any reason for another organization, or another
paper. If you printed straight socialism it might be different.
Yours truly,
MARY W. OVINGTON.
These "good white people" must really forgive us for
insisting that we are not children, and that; while, we
want all the friends we can get, we need no benevolent
dictators. It is we, and not they, who must shape Negro
policies. If they want to help in carrying them out we
will appreciate their help.
Just now the white people-even in the South-have
felt the pressure of the new Negro's manhood demands:
in spite of the fact that backward-looking Negroes like
The Age's editor condemn the inflexible spirit of these
demands. All over the South, the white papers, scared
by the exodus of Negro laborers who are tired of begging
for justice overdue, are saying that we are right, and
friendlier legislation has begun to appear on Southern
statutc books. Mr. Mencken and other Southern writers
are saying that the Negro is demanding, and that the
South had better accede to his just demands, as it is only
a matter of time when he will be in position to enforce
them. One should think, then, that those who have been
parading as our professional friends would be in the van
of this manhood movement. But the movement seems
to have left them in the rear. Now, that we are demand-
ing the whole loaf, they are begging for half, and are
angry at us for going further than they think "nice."

WHEN AFRICA AWAKES
It was the N. A. A.C.P. which was urging 11s to com-
promise our manhood by begging cagerly for "Jim Crow"
training camps. And the same group is asking, in the
November Crisis, that we put a collective power-of-attor-
ney into their hands and leave it to them to shape our na-
tional destiny. The N. A. A. C. P. has done much good
work for Negroes--splendid work--in fighting lynching
and segregation. for that we owe it more gratitude and
good will than we owe to the entire Republican party
for the last sixty years of its existence. But we cannot,
even in this case, al«licate our right to shape more radical
policies for ourselves. It was the realization of the need
for a more radical policy than that of the N. A. A. C. P.
that called into being the Liberty League of Negro
Americans. Ind the N. A. A. C, P., as mother, must for-
give its offspring for forging farther ahead.
Then, there is the case of the New York Evening Post,
of which Mr. Villard is owner. This paper was known
far and wide as “a friend to Negrocs.” But its friendship
has given way to indifference and worse. In the good old
days cvery lynching received velitorial condemnation. But
the three great lynchings this year which preceded East
St. Louis found no editorial of condemnation in the Post.
It was more than luke-warm then. But, alack and alas !
As soon as the Negro soldiers in Houston, goaded to
retaliation by gross indignities, did some shooting on
their own account, the livening Post, which had no con-
demnation of the conduct of the lynchers, joined the
chorus of those who were screaming for “punishment"
and death. Here is its brief editorial on August 25th :
As no provocation could justify the crimes committed by
mutinous Negro soldiers at Houston, Texas, so no condemnation
of their conduct can be too severe. It may be that the local

authorities were not wholly blameless, and that the commanding
officers were at fault in not foreseeing the troubic and taking
steps to guard against it. But nothing can really palliate the
offence of the soldiers. They were false to their uniform; they
were false to their race. In one sense, this is the most deplor.
able aspect of the whole riotous outbreak. It will play straight
into the hands of men like Senator Vardaman who have been
saying that it was dangerous to draft colored men into the army.
And the feeling against having colored troops encamped in the
South will be intensified. The grievous harm which they might
do to their own people should have been all along in the minds
of the colored soldiers, and made them doubly circumspect. They
were under special obligation, in addition to their military oath,
to conduct themselves so as not to bring reproach upon the
Negroes as a whole, of whom they were in a sort represcntative.
Their criminal outrage will tend to make people forget the good
work donc hy other Negro soldiers. After the rigid investigation
which the War Department has ordered. the men found guilty
should receive the severest punishment. As for the general army
policy affecting colored troops, we are glad to see that Secretary
Baker appears to intend no change in his recent orders.
We ourscives cannot forget that while the question of
whether the Post's editor would get a diplomatic ap-
pointnient (like some other editors) was under consider-
ation during the first year of Woodrow Wilson's first ad-
ministration, the Post pretended to believe that the Presi-
dent didn't know of the segregation practiced in the gov.
ernment departments. The N. A. A. C. P., whose letter
sent out at the time is now before us, pretended to the
same effect.
After viewing these expressions of frightful friend-
liness in our own times, we have reached the conclusion
that the time has come when we should insist on being,
our own best friends. We may make mistakes, of course,
but we ought to be allowed to make our own inistakes-
as other people are allowed to do. If friendship is to

Shillady Resigns
Mr. Jolun R. Shillady.cx-secretary of the N. A.A.C. P'..
states in his letter of resignation that "I am less confident
than heretofore of the speedy success of the association's
full program and of the probability of overcoming within
a reasonable period the forces opposed to Negro equality
loy the means and methods which are within the associa-
tion's power to employ." In this one sentence Mr. Shil-
lady, the worker on the inside', puts in sunve and screncly
diplomatie plorase the truth which people on the outside
have long ago, perceivedl, namely, that the N. A. A, C, P.
makes a joke of itself when it affects to think that lynch-
ing and the other evils which beset the Negro in the South
can be abolished by simple publicity. The great weakness
of the National Association for the Avancement of
Colored Periple has been and is thal, whereas it aims 10
secure certain results by affecting the minds of white peo-
ple and making them friendly to it, it has no control over
these minds and has absolutely no answer to the question,
"What steps to you propose to take if these minds at
which you are aining remain unaffected? What do yout
piropose to do to secure life and liberty for the Negro if
the white Southernier persists, as hc has persisted for sixty
years, in refusing to grant guarantees of life and liberty ?"
The N. A, A, C, P, has done some good and worth-while
work as an organization of protest. But the times call for
something more effective than protests addressed to the

other fellow's consciousness. What is needed at present
is more of the mobilizing of the Negro's political power,
pocketbook power and intellectual power (which are abso-
Jutcly within the Negro's own control) to do for the Negro
the things which the Negro necols to have done without
depending upon or waiting for the co-operative action of
white people. This co-operative action, whenever it does
come, is a boon that no Negro, intelligent or unintelligent,
affects to despise. But no Negro of clear vision, whether
he be a leader or not, can afford to predicate the progress
of the Negro upon such co-operative action, because it
may not come.
Mr. Shillady may have seen these things. It is high
time that all Negrocs sec these things whether their white
professional friends see them or not.--July, 1920.
Our White Friends
In the ground olid days whien the black man's highest value
in the white man's cyc was that of an object of benevo-
lence especially provideel hy the Divine mind for calling
out those tender 0111-Jaagrings of charity which were so
clear to the self-satisfied Caucasian—in those days the
white men who fraternized with black people could do
so as their guides, philosophers and friends without
incurring any hostility on the part of black folk. Today,
however, the white man who mixes with the black boruthier
is having a hard time of it. Somehow Iam's offspring
no longer fcels proud of being taken up" by the progeny
of Japhet. And when the white man insists on mixing in
with him the colored brother will persist in attributing
ulterior motives.

hlinkers of Anglo-Saxon civilization and sees that the
relations of the white and black race have changed and
arr changing all over the world. Such an observer would
note that the most significant fact of the growing race
Osciousness is to be found in the inevitable second half
of the word. It isn't because these darker people are
motivated by race that their present state of mind consti-
tistes a danger to Caucasian overlordship. It is because
they have developed consciousness, intelligence, under.
standing. They have learned that the white brother is
perfectly willing to love thems---"in their place." They
have learned that that place is one in which they are not
to develop brains and initiative, but must furnish the
brawn and muscle whereby the white man's brain and
initiative can take cternally the products of their brawn
and muscle. There are today many white men who will
befriend the Negro, who will give their dollars to his
comfort and welfare, so long as the idea of what con-
stitutes that comfort and welfare comes entirely from the
white man's mind. Examples like those of Dr. Spingar
and Mr. E. D. Morel are numerous.
And not for nothing does the black man balk at the
white man's "mmixing in." For there are spies everywhere
and the agent provocateur is abroad in the land. From
Chicago conies the news by way of the Associated Press
( white) that Dr. Jonas, who has always insisted in stick-
ing his nose into the Negro pcoples' affairs as their guide,
philosopher and friend, has been forced to confess that he
is a government agent, presumably paid for things which
the government would later suppress. Dr. Jonas is re-
ported to have said that he is connected with the British
secret service; but since the second year of the European
war it has been rather difficult for us poor devils to tell
where the American government ended and the British

government began, especially in these inaliers. In any
case, we have lor. Jonas' confession, and all the silly
Negroes who listencil approvingly in the senseless allega-
tions made by Alessrs. Jonas, Gabriel and others of a
standing army of 4,000,000 in Abyssinia and of Japanese-
Abyssinian diplomatic relations and intentions, must feel
now very foolish about the final result.
How natural it was that Jonas, the white leader, should
have gone scot free, while Rodding and his other Negro
dupes are held! How natural that Jonas should be the one
to positively identify Redding as the slayer of the Negro
policeman! And so, once again, that section of the Negro
race that will not follow except where a white man leads
will have to pay that stern penalty whereby Dame Expe.
rience teaches her dunces. Uuder the present circuni-
stances we, the Negroes of the Western world, do pledge
our allegiance to leaders of our own race, sclected by our
own group and supported financially and otherwise exclu-
sively by us. Their leadership may be wise or otherwise ;
they may inake mistakes here and there; nevertheless,
such sins as they may commit will be our sins, and all the
glory that they may achieve will be our glory. We prefer
it so. It may be worth the while of the white men who
desire to be "Our Professional Friends” to take note of
this preference.
A Tender Point
When the convention of turtles assembled on the Grand
Banks of Newfoundland it was found absolutely impos-
sible to get a tortoise elected as leader. All turtles, con-
servative and radical, agreed that a land and water
creature, who was half one thing and half another, was not
an ideal choice for leader of a group which lived exclu-

sively in the water. Whenever a leader of the Irish has
to be selected by the Irish it is an Irisliman who is selected.
No Irishmanı would be inclineel to dispite the fact that
other men, even Englislımen like John Stuart Mill and the
late Keir llardie, could feel the woes of Ireland as pro-
foundly as any Irishuman. But they prefer to live up 10 ile
principle of "Safety first."
These two illustrations are to be taken as a preludė to
an important point which is not often discussed in the
Negro press because all of us--black, brown and parti-
colorect--fcar to offend each other. That point concerns
the biological brevel of persons who should be selected
by Negroes as leaders of their race. We risk the offense
this time 'cause efficiency in matters of racial leadership,
as. in other matters, should 1104 be too temler to these
points of prejudice when they stand in the way of lesir-
able results. For two centuries in America we, the de.
scendants of the black Negroes of Africa, have been
told by: white men that we cannot and will not amount
to anything except in so far as we first accept the bar
sinister of their mixing with us. Always when white peo-
ple had to select a leader for Negroes they would select
some one who had in his veins the blood of the selectors.
In the good okl days when slavery was in flower, it was
those whowa Denmark Vesey of Charleston described as
"house niggers" who got the master's cast-off clothes,
the better scraps of food and culture which fell from
the white man's table, who were looked upon as the
Talented Tenth of the Negro race. The opportunities of
self-improvement, in so far as they lay within the hand of
the white race, were accorded exclusively to this class of
people who were the left-handed progeny of the white
minsters.
Out of this grew a certain attitude on their part

towards the rest of the Negro people which, unfortir-
nately, has not yet been outgrowni. In Washington, Bos-
ton, Charleston, New York and Chicago thcsc proponents
of the lily-white idca arc prone to erect around their
sacred personalities a high wall of caste, based on the
ground of color. And the black Negrocs have hercto-
fore worshipped at the altars crected on these walls. Onc
sees this in the Baptist, Methodist and Episcopal churches,
at the various conventions and in fraternal organizations.
Black people themselves seem to hold the degrading vi'w
that a man who is but half a Negro is twice as worthy
of their respect and support as one who is entirely black.
We have seen in the social life of some of the places men-
tioned how women, undeniably black and undeniably
beautiful, have been shunned and ostracised at public
functions by men who should be presumed to know bet-
ter. We have read the fervid jeremiads of "colored"
meni who, when addressing the whites on behalf of some
privilege which they wished to share with them, woulel
be, in words, as black as the acc of spades, but, wlien it
came to mixing with "their kind," they were professional
lily-whites, and we have often had to point out to them
that there is no color prejudice in America--except among
"colored" people. Those who may be inclined to be angry
at the broaching of this subject are respectfully requested
to ponder that pungent fact.
In this matter white people, even in America, are in-
clined to be more liberal than colored people. If a while
man has no race prejudicc, it will be found that he doesn't
care how black is the Negro friend that hc takes to his .
home and his bosom. Even these white people who pick
leaders for Negroes have begun in these latter years to.
give formal and official expression to this principle. Thus
it was that when the trustecs of Tuskegcc had to clect

a licad of Tuskegec and a putative leader of the Negrocs
of Ainerica to succeed the late Dr. Washington, they
argued that it was now necessary to select as leader for
the Negro people a man who could not be mistaken by any
one for anything other than a Negro. Therefore, Mr.
Emmett Scott was passed over and Dr. Robert R. Morton
was selected. We are not approving here the results of
that selection, but merely holding up to Negroes the prin-
ciple by which it was governed.
So long as we ourselves acquiesce in the selection of
leaders on the ground of their unlikeness to our racial
type, just so long wi!l we be met by the invincible argu-
ment that white blood is necessary to make a Negro worth
while. Every Negro who has respect for himself and for
his race will feel, when contemplating such examples as
Toussaint Louverture, Phyllis Wheatley, Paul Laurence
Dunbar and. Samuel Ringgold Ward, the thrill of
pride that differs in quality and intensity from
the feeling which he experiences when contemplating
other examples of great Negroes who are not entirely
black. For it is impossible in such cases for the white
mien to argue that they owed their greatness or thcir
prominence to the blood of the white race which was
mingled in their veins. It is a legitimate thrill of pride,
for it gives us a hope nobler than the hope of amalgama-
tion whereby, in order to become men, we must lose our
racial identity. It is a subject for sober and serious re-
flection, and it is hoped that sober and serious reflection
will be given to it.
The Descent of Du Bois
In a recent bulletin of the War Department it was
declared that “justifiable grievances" were producing and


## p. 67 (#74) ##############################################

LEADERSHIP
had produced "not disloyalty, but an amount of unrest
and bitterness which cven the best efforts of their leaders
may not be able always to guidc." This is the simple
truth. The essence of the present situation lies in the
fact that the people whom our white masters have
"recognized" as our Icaders (without taking the trouble
10 consult 11s) and those who, by our own selection, had
actually attaincel 10 leadership among us arc being re-
valuated and, in most cases, rejected..
The most striking instance from the latter class is Dr.
W. E. Du Bois, the editor of the Crisis. Du Bois's casc
is the more significant localise his former services to his
race have been undoubtedly of a high and courageous
sort. Moreover, the act by which he has brought upon
himself the stormy outburst of disapproval from his race
is one which of itself, would seem to merit no such stern
condemnation. To properly gauge the value and merit
of this disapproval one must view it in the light of its
attendant circumstances and of the situation in which
it arose.
Dr. Du Bois first palpably sinned in his colitorial
"Close Ranks” in the July number of the Crisis. But
this offense (apart from the trend and general tenor of
the brief editorial) lies in a single sentence: “Let us,
while this war lasts, forget our special grievances and
close our ranks, shoulder to shoulder with our white
fellow-citizens and the allied nations that are fighting for
democracy." From the latter part of the sentence there
is no dissent, so far as we know. The offense lies in
that part of the sentence which ends with the italicized
words. It is felt by all his critics, that Du Bois, of all
Negroes, knows best that our "special grievances" which
the War Department Bulletin describes as "justifiable"

WIEN URRICA TWARES
consist of lynching, segregation and disfranchisement,
and tliat the Negroes of America can not preserve cither
their lives, their manhood or their vote (which is their
political life and libertics) with these things in existence,
The doctor's critics fcel that America can not use the
Negro people to any good effect unless they have liſe,
liberty and manhood assured and gunranteed to them.
Therefore, instead of the war for democracy making
these things less necessary, it makes them more so.
"But," it may be asked, "why should not these few
words be taken merely as a slip of the pen or a venial
error in legic? Why all this hubbub?" It is because the
so-called leaders of the first-inentioned class have already
established an unsavory reputation by advocating this
same surrender of life, liberty and manhood, masking
their cowardice behind the pillars of war-time sacrifice?
Du Bois's statement, then, is believed to mark his entrance
into that class, and is accepted as a "surrender" of the
principles which brought him into prominence - and
which alone kept him there,
Later, when it was learned that Du Bois was being
preened for a berth in the War Department as a captain-
assistant (ndjutant) to Major Spingarn, the worlds used
loy liim in the editorial acquired a darker and more
sinister significance. The two things fitted too well 10-
Brother as motive and self-interest.
for these reasons Du Bois is regarded much in the
saline way as a knight in the middle ages who had had his
armor stripped from him, his armis reversed and his spurs
hacked off. This ruins him as an influential person

learned that thic Crisis was being investigated log the
government for an alleged seditious litterance is great
clamor went up, although the expression of it was not
opeu. Negroes who dared to express their thoughts
seemed to think the action tantamount to il declaration
that protests against lynching, segregation and disfran-
chisement were outlnwed by the government. But noth-
ing was clearly understood until the conference of clitor's
was called under the assumed auspices of Emmet Scott
and Major Spingarn. Then it began to appear that these
editors had not been called without a pirpose. The
(lesperate ambiguity of the language which they irseel in
their report (in thc War Department Bulletin), coupled
with the fact that not one of them, ipon his return would
tell the people anything of the proceedings of the con-
ferencc-all this made the Negrocs fcel less and less con-
fidence in them and their leadership; made them (as
leaders) less effective instruments for the influential
control of the race's state of mind.
Now Du Bois was one of the most prominent of those
celitors "who were called." The responsibility, therefore,
for a course of cinsel which stresses the servile virtues
of acquiescence and subservience falls squarely on his
shoulders. The offer of a captaincy and Du Bois's Mirta-
tion with that offer following on the heels of these things
seemed, even in the eyes of his associate members of tịc
N. A. A. C. P. to afford clear proof of that which was
only a suspicion before, viz: that the racial resolution of
the lenders had been tampered with, and that Di Beris
had been privy to something of the sort. The connection
between the successive acts of the drama (May, June,
July) was too clear to admit of any interpretation other
than that of deliberate, cold blooded, purposivc planning.
And the connection with Spingarn seemed to suggest that

for the sake of the larger lisefulness of Dr. Du Bois
we hope he will be able to show that he can remain as
editor of the Crisis; but we ſcar that it will require a good
deal of explaining. For, our leaders, like Caesar's wife,
must be above suspicion.--July, 1918.
When the Blind Lead
In the fiebruary issue of the Crisis its editor begins a
brief editorial on "Leadership,” with the touching re-
minder that "Many it good cause has been killed by
suspected leadership," How strikingly do these words
bring back to lis Negroes those dark days of 1918! At
that time the clitor of the Crisis was offering certain
unique : formulas of leadership that somehow didn't
"lake," lis "Close Kanks" erditorial and the subscquent
slump in the stock of his leadership liave again illustrated
the truth long since expressed in Latin: "Descensus
Iverni facilis; ser revocare gradus,--hoc opus est."
which, being translated, might mean that, while it's als
easy as crus for a leader to fall off the fence, it is clevil-
ishly difficult to boost him up again. In September, 1918,
one could bollly say. "The Crisis says, first your Country,
Then your Rights !" "Today, when the Negro people every.
where are responding to Mr. Michael Coulsen's sentiment
that "it's Race, not Country, first," we find the "leader" of
1918 in the position described by Lowell in these words:
"A moultin' fallen cherubim, ef he should see ye'd snicker,
Thinkin' he warnt a suckenistance."

could succeed?" He notes that willt of the World War,
with the Allies triumphant, have come Britain's brutal
domination of thic scas, lier conquest of Persia, Arabin
and Egypt, and her tremendous tyranny imposed on two-
thirds of Africa.
But we saw these things, as carly as 1917, to be the
necessary conquences of the Allics' success, when the
editor of thic Crisis was telling his race: "You are not
fighting simply for Europe; you are fighting for the
world." Was Dr. Du Bois so blind then that he couldn't
see them? And if he was, is hic any loss blind tolay? In
1918 thc lynchings were still going on while Dr. Du Bois
was soleninly advising its to "forget our grievances." Any
one who insisted then on puitting such grievances as
lynchings, disfranchisement and segregation in the fore-
ground was described by the Crisis' cditor as sccking "to
turn his country's tragic predicament to his own personal
gain." At that time he cither believed or pretended to
believe every one of the empty words that Nowed from
Woodrow Wilson's lips, and on the basis of this belief
he was willing to act as a brilliant bellwether to the rest
of the flock. Unfortunately, the flock refused to follow
the lost Icader.
"If the blind Icad the blind they will both fall into the
ditch." But in this case those being led were not quite so
blind as those who wanted to lead them by way of cap-

were not forthcoming. The test of vision in a leader is
the ability to foresee the immediate future, the necessary
consequences of a course of conduct and the dependable
sentimients of those whom he assumes to Icad. In all
these things Dr. Du Bois has failed; and neither his uin.
grateful attack on Emmett Scott nor his belated discovery
or Wilsonian hypocrisy will, we fear, enable him to climb
back into the saddle of race leadership. This is a pity,
because he has rendered good service in his day. But that
clay is post. The magazine which lic edits still remains as
a splendid example of Negro journalism. But the per-

The peniple's spiritual appetite has changed and they

It can hold any quantity on 'em--the belly can--
An' bring 'em up ready fer use like the pelican."
And this is a change which we commend to the kindly
consideration of all those good white friends who are out
selecting Negro "leaders." It is a fact which, when care-
fully considered, will save them thousands of dollars in
"overhead expense.” The Negro leaders of the future

luscious than Sea Cralus, being more l'rimitive and more

He dug into their holes with his stick,
routed them out, packed them on their hacks in his basket
and took them home. Several trips he made with his
basket and his stick, and all the Crabs which he caught
were dumped into a luge barrel. (But this time he didn't
pack them on their backs.) And all the creatures stood
around and watched. For this Grecdy Person had put
no cover on the barrel. (But this was in the Beginning

He knew Crab Nature, and was not at all worried about
his (rabs. For as soon as any one Crab began to climb
up on the side of the barrel to work his way toward the

THE NEW RACE-CONSCIOUSNESS
The Negro's Own Radicalism
Twenty years ago all Negroes known to the white
publicises of America could be classed as conservatives
on all the great questions on which thinkers differ. In
matters of industry, commerce, politics, religion, they
could be trusted to take the backward view. Only on the
question of the Negru's "rights" could a small handful
Tre found bold enough to be tagged as "radicals"--and
they were howled down by both the white and colored
adherents of the conservative point of view. Today
Negroes differ on all those great questions on which white
Thinker: differ, and there are Negro radicals of every
imaginary stripe--agnostics, atheists, I.' W. W.'s Social-
ists, Single Taxers, and even Bolshevists.
In the good old days w.vite people derived their knowl-
edge of what Negroes were doing from those Negroes
who were nearest to then, generally their own selected
exponents of Negro activity or of their white point of
view. A classic illustration of this kind of knowledge was
atřorded by the Republican Party; but the Episcopal
Church, the Urban League, or the U. S. Government
would serve as well. Today the white world is vaguely,
but disquietingly, aware that Negroes are awake, different
ind perplexingly uncertain. Yet the white world by
which they are surrounded retains its traditional inethod
of interpreting the mass by the Negro nearest to them-

that the "unrest" now apparent in the Negro masse is

believes that it will function largely along the lines of

mainly with their chosen task of being the mental bell-
wethers of the moh, scream "Bolshevist propaganda" and
flatter themselves that they have found the true cause:
while the government's unreliable agents envisage it as

like Lester Ward to scavengers like Stevenson, deign to
consider the colored population of twelve millions.
In the first place, the cause of "radicalism” amork
American Negroes is international. But it is necessary to
draw clear distinctions at the outset. The function of

"internationalism” to cover the present case of the Negro

national Fact to which Negroes in Anterica are now re-

but the social, political and economic subjection of colorecl
peoples by white. It is not the Class Line, but the Color

the Dead Line of racial inferiority. This fact is a fact of
Negro consciousness as well as a fact of externals. The

It is necessary to insist on this point today when the
Socialist party of America has secretly subsidizea booth it
magazine and it newspaper to attempt to cut into the
splendlie wilidarity whicho Negroes are achieving in re-
sponse to the call of racial necessity. It is necessary to
point out that “radical" young Negroes may betray thc in-
terests of ihe race into alien hands just as surely as "the
oli crowd." for, alter all, the essence of both betrayals
consists in making the racial requirements play sccomel
fidille 10 the requirements dictated as best for it by other
groups with other interests to serve. The fact that one
group or alicui interests is described as "radical" and the
other as "reactionary" is of very slight value to 11s.
In the days when the Socialist l'arty of America was
respectable, although it never drew lines of racial separa-
tion in the North, it permitted those lines to be drawn in
the South. It had 110 world of official condemnation for
the Socialists of Tennessee who prevented Theresa Mala
kiel in 1912 from lecturing to Negrocs on Socialism cither
in the same hall with them or in meetings of their own.

until they changed their party's attitude toward the Negro
masses. They scouted this warning because the Negroes
whom they had selected to interpret Negro sentiment for
them still confidently assured them that there had been
no change of sentiment on the part of the Negro people,
and white politicians did not think it necessary 10 comie

All this is recent history, and it is called to your atten- .
tion at this time only because you are in danger of making
a similar costly mistake. You, too, have selected Negru
spokesmen on whose word you choose to rely for in-

method of the white Republican politicians, and you do
not care to go behind the word of your selected exponents
of Negro thought and feeling. Yet the pitiful voto which
you polled in the last election might have warned you that
something had gone wrong in your arrangements. What
that something is we shall now proceed to show you -if

During the recent world war the Negro in America was

the concept of race. Even in the throes of war, and on

the battlefields of France it was "race first" with them.
Out of this realization was born the new Negro ideal
of "race first" for us. And today, whether Negroes be
Catholics or Protestants, capitalists or wage workers, Re-
publicans or Democrats, native or foreign-born, they begin
life anew on this basis. Alike in their business alignments,
their demands on the government and political parties,
and in their courageous response to race rioters, they are
responding to this sentiment which has been bred by the
attitude of white men here and everywhere else where
white rules black. To be sure, neither Burleson nor
Palmer have told you or the rest of the white world this.
The Angle-Saxon white man is a notorious hypocrite; and
they have preferred to prate of Bolshevism--your
"radicalism"-rather than tell the truth of racialism, our
"radicalism," because this was an easier explanation,
more in keeping with official stupidity. But we had sup-
posed that you were intelligent enough to find this out.
Eviclently, you were not.
Your official Negro exponents, on behalf of their bread
and butter, have seized on this widely-published official
explanation to make you believe that the changed atti-
tude of the Negro masses was due to the propaganda
which you were paying them ( at their published request )
to prcach. But this is a lie. Don't take our word for it.
Do some reading on your own account. Get a hundred
different Negro newspapers and magazines, outside of
those which you have subsidized, and study their editorial
and other pronouncements, and you will see that this is so.
But let us come nearer home. The propaganda of
Socialism has been preached in times past in Harlem by
different people without awakening hostility of any sort.
Today it elicits a hostility which is outspoken. Send up

lished without any help from yo:1 or those who cat your
bread. Even the work of Socialist propaganda was niegº
lected by you between 1912 and 1917. Consult your own
memories and the columns of, the Call.
All these things are the recent products of the prin-
ciple of "race first." And among them the biggest is the
Universal Negro Improvement Association, with its as-
sociate bodies, the Black Star Line and the Negro Fac-
tories Corporation.
No movement among American
Negroes since slavery was abolished has ever attained the
gigantic proportions of this. The love and loyalty of
millions go out to it as well as the cold cash of tens of
thousands. Yet your Negro hirelings have seen fit to
use the organs which you have given them to spread
Socialist propaganda for the purpose of attacking all
these things, and the Black Star Line in particular. Do
you wonder now that they meet with such outspoken op-
position that they have been driven to seek an under-
handed alliance with the police (as your Negro Socialist
organ avows in its latest issue)? Isn't that a glorious .
alliance for purposes of Negro propaganda ? When such
things can happen you may depend upon it that some-
onc has been fooling you.
And, just as the white Republicans did, you have
assumed that those whom chance or change brought
your way have, somehow, achieved a monopoly
of the intellect and virtue of the Negro race.

is your henchmen's sole contribution to “sociology"--for

case. And yet, those whom you have selected to repre-
sent you are so green and sappy in their Socialism that,
although six wecks have elapsed since this was hurled at
their thick heads, not one of them has yet been able to
trace to its source, this quotation from one of your own

"Patronise Your Own."
The doctrine of "Race First," although utilized largely
by the Negro business men of Harlem, has never received
any large general support from them. If we remember
rightly, it was the direct product of the out-door and in-
door lecturers who nourished in Harlem between 1914
and 1916. Not all who were radical shared this senti-
micuit.
For instance, we remember the debate between
Mr. Hubert Harrison, then president of the Liberty
Leagite, and Mr. Chanler Owen, at Palace Casino in
December, 1918, in which the "radical" Owen fiercely
maintained "that the doctrine of race first was an in-
deſensible doctrine“: Mr. Harrison maintaining that it
was the source of salvation for the race. Both these
gentlemen have run true to formi ever since.
But to return to our thesis. The secondary principle
of "pratronize your own," Aowing as it does from the main
doctrine of “race first,” is subject to the risk of being ex-
ploited dishonestly--particularly by business micn. Arld
business men in Harlem have shown themselves capable
of doing this all the time. They seem to forget that "do
into others as you would have them do into you" is a
part of the honest application of this doctrine. Many of
these men seem to want other black people to pay them
for being black. They seem to think that dirty place
and imperfect service and 3 cerits more a pound should
be rewarded with racial patronage regardless of these
demerits.
On the other hand, there have grown tip in Harlem
Negro businesses, groceries, ice cream parlors, etc., in
which the application prices, courtesy and selling
efficiency are maintained. This is the New Negro busi-
ness man, and we sny "more power to him." If this

makes a hash of racial welfare in the attempt to achieve
individual success. A case in point is that of the brown-
skinned dolls. Twenty years ago the Negro child's only
choice was between a white Caucasian doll and the "nigger
doll." On the lower levels the one was as chcap as the
other. Then, a step at a time came the picturesque poupee,
variously described as the “Negro (loll," the "colored
doll" and the "brown-skinned doll." This was sold by
white stores at an almost prohibitive price. It was made
three times as casy for the Negro child to idolize a while
doll as to idulize one with the ſcatures of its own racc.
When the principle of "Race First" began to be proclaimed
from scores of platforms and pulpits, certain Negro
business men saw a chance to benefit the race and, in-
cidently to reap a wonderful harvest of profits, by appeal-
ing to a principle for whose support and maintenance, here
and olsewhere, they had never paid a cent. "Factories"
for the production of brown-skinned dolls began to spring
tip--snost of the factoring consisting of receiving these
dolls from white factories and either stufling them with
saw dust, excelsior or other filling, or merely changing
them from one wrapper to another. Bear in mind that
the proclaimed object was to make it easier for the Negro
mother to teach race patriotism to her Negro child. Yet
it was soon notorious that these lecches were charging
$.3. $4 and $5 for Negro sulle which could sell at prices
ranging from 75 cents 100 $1.25, and yet leave a linnisome
margin of profit

The result is that today even in Negru Harlem nine out
of ten Negro children are forced to play with white colls,
because rapacious scoundrels have been capitalizing the
principle of "patronize your own" in a one-sided way. By
lowering their prices to a reasonable level, they could es-
tend their business tremendously. l'ailing to do this, they
are playing into the hands of the vendors of white colls
anel making it much easier for the Negro mother to select
it white doll for lier chill; limiting at once their own
market and restricting the development of a larger racial
ideal,
The Women of Our Race.
America owes much to the foreigner and thic Negro in
Anicrica owes even more. For it was the white for-
cigner who first proclaimed that the only music which
America had produced that was worthy of the name was
Negro music. It naturally took some time for this truth
to sink in, and, in the mcantime, the younger element of
Negroes, in their weird worship of everything that was
white, neglected and despised their own race-nusic. More
than one college class had walked out, highly insulted,
when their white teachers had asked them to sing "Swing
1.ow Sweet Chariot" and "My Lord. What a Morning."
It is to he hoped that they now know better.
But the real subject of this editorial is not Negro music,
but Negro women. If any foreigner should come here
from Europe, Asia or Africa and be privileged to pass in

brethren in church and loilge when they want hier to turn
their functions into financial successes, and outside of
Paul Dunbar and perhaps two other poets, 110 proper
amount of esthetic appreciation of her has been forthcom-
ing from their side.
Consider the facts of the case. The white women of
America are charming to look it in the topper social
classes. But even the Negro latdress, cook or elevator-
girl far surpasses her mistress in the matter of feminine
charms. Nro white woman has it color as beautiful as the
dark browns, light-browns, peach-browns, or gull and
luronze of the Negro girl. These are some of the things
which make a walk through any Negro section of New
York or Washington such a feast of delight.
Then, there is the matter of form. The bodies and
limbs of our Negro women are, on the whole, better built
and heiter shaped than those of any other women on earth
--<xcept perhaps, the Egyptian women's. And their gait
and movement would require an artist to properly
describe. The grace of their carriage is inimitable.
But their most striking characteristic is a feature which
even the crude mind or mere man can appreciate. It is,
to quote "Gunga Din." "the way in which they carry
their clothes." They (ress well--not merely in the sense
that their clothing is costly and good to look nt; but in
that higher senise in which the Parisinn woman is the best-
dressed woman in kurope. From shoes and stockings to
shirt waists and lints, they choose their clothes with line
taste and show them off to the best advantnge when they
print them on. That is why it man mny walk down the

only in school and in college, but in books and newspapers,
in market-places, institutions, and movements. Prepare
by knowing; and never think you know until you have
listened to ten others who know differently--and have

The young man's second duty is IRREVERENCE.
Reverence is in onc sense, respect for what is antiquated
because it is antiquated. This race has lived in a rut
100 long to reverence the rut. Oldsters love ruts because
they help them to "rub along," they are casy to under-
stand; they require the minimum of exertion and brains,
and they give the maximum of case. Young man! If
you wish to be spiritually alert and alive; to get the very
best out of yourself-shun a rut as you would shun the
plague! Never bow the knee to Baal because Baal is in
power; never respect wrong and injustice because they arc
enshrined in the sacrcd institutions of our glorious land";
never have patience with either Cowardicc or Stupidity
because they happen to wear venerable whiskers. Read,
reason, and think on all sides of all subjects. Don't com-
pare yourself with the runner behind you on the roadl:
always compare yourself with the one ahead; so only will
you go faster and farthe •: And set it before you, as a
sacred duty always to surpass the tcachers that taught yout
and this is the essence of irreverence.
The last great duty is COURAGE. Dear man of my
people, if all else should fail you, never let that fail.

in need of courage. This has been, and is yet, i DOWN-

CHAPTER VII.
OUR INTERNATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS.
(The ideas expressed in the title of this chapter were formu-
lated as early as 1915 when I was in the unique position of
being the black leader and lecturer of a white lecture forum,
organized by white liberals, radicals and others at the uld
Lenox l'asilo, at 110th St. & Lenox Ave., New York City,
What white people in general thought of the value of my
services at this forum can be reall in a letter written by a
white southernter and appearing in the New York Globe of
December 15, 1920. After the closing of this lecture forum the
same explanation of the racial significance of the whole pro-
cess of the war was expressed in other lectures given to white
people at a lecture forum which I maintained in the Browns-
ville section of Brooklyn. I make these explanations here
because I value somewhat the point of priority in the face
of Mr. Lothrop Stoddarel's remarkable book, "The Rising
Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy" and the
sweeping title of racial consciousness which found expression
subsequently in thosc Negro newspapers and magazines which
have been called radical.)
The White War and the Colored World.
The newspapers which we read every day inforni us
that the world is al war. Searching the pages of the
statisticians, we find that the world is made up of 17 hun-
dred million people of which 12 Inundred million are col-
ured--black and brown and yellow. This vast majority is
at peace and remains at peace until the white monority de-
termines otherwise. The war in Europe is a war of the
white race wherein the stakes of conflict are the titles to

possession of the lands and destinies of this colorcol ma-
jority in Asia, Africa and the islands of the sea.
There can be no doubt that the white race as it cxists
today, is the superior race of the world. And it is sue
perior, not bccausc it has better manncrs morc religion
or a higher culture; thcsc things are metaphysical and
subject to dispute. The white race rests its claim to
superiority on the frankly materialistic ground that it has
the gums, soldiers, the money and resources to keep it
in the position of the top-clog and to make its will go.
This is what white men mean by civilization, disguise it
how they may. This struggle is a conflict of wills and in.
terests among the various nations which make up the
white race, to determine whose will shall be accepted as
the collective will of the white racc; to decide, at least for
this century, who shall lie thic inlcritors of thic lands of
Africn and Asin and dictators of thc lives and destinics
of their colored inluabitants.
Thc peculiar feature of the conflict is that thic white
race in its fratricidal strife is burning 11p, cating up, con-
suming and destroying these very resources of ships,
guns, men and money upon which its superiority is built.
They are bent upon this form of self-destruction and
nothing that we can say will stop them,
As representatives of one of the races constituting the
colored majority of the world, we dcplore the agony and
blood-shed; but we find consolation in the hope that when
this white world shall have been washed clean by its
baptismi of blood, the white race will be less able to thrust
the strong hand of its sovereign will down the throats of
the other races. We look for a frce India and an inde-
pendent Egypt; for nationalities in Africa flying their own
flags and dictating their own internal and foreign policies.

fail to establish "peace on carthi and good will toward
men." For the majority races cannot le eternally coerced
into accepting the sovereignity of the white race. They
are willing to live in a world which is the equal possession
of all peoples-- white, black, brown and yellow. If the
white race is willing. they will live at peace with it. But
if it insists that freedom, democracy and equality are to
exist only for white men, then, there will be such blood-
shed later as this world has never seen. And there is 110
certainty that in such a conflict the white race will come
out on top. Not the destinies of the world, but the desti-
nies of the white race are in the hands of the whtie
race.--1917.
U-Need-a Biscuit.
There is one advertisement which appears in the maga-
zines, on the streets and bill boards which has always
seemed to us a masterly illustration of the principle of
repetition. When going to work in the morning we look
up from our daily newspaper and see the Haring sign
which states that ul-need-a Biscuit, we may ignore its
appeal the first time, but as the days go by the onstant
insistence reaches our inner consciousness and we decide
that perhaps after all we do need a biscuit. At any rate,
whenever we have biscuits to buy it is natural that the
biscuit which has been most persistently advertised should
rerur at once to our minds and that we should buy that
particular biscuit.

a loss to account for the new spirit which has come over

Others tell us that it is the product of nlicn ngitators, and
yet others are coming to the front with the novel cx-

Perhaps we are wasting our time in offering an ex-

Now, we Negroes, Egyptians and Hindus, under the
pressure of democracy's commercial drummers, havc dc-
veloped a democratic complex which in its turbulent in-
sistence is apt to trouble the firms for whom these drum-
mers drunmed: Because they haven't any of the goods
•which they advertised in the first place, and in the second

Our Larger Duty.
The problemu of the twentieth century is the problemi

crned after such fashion as the dominant white race may
decide. Consider for a nioment the full meaning of this
fact. Of the seventeen hundred million people that dwell
on our carth today more than twelve hundred million are
colored--black and brown and yellow. The so-called
white race is, of course, the superior racc. That is to say,
it is on top hy virtuc of its control of the physical force
of the world—ships, guins, soldiers, money and other re-
sources. By virtue of this control lingland rules and rolos
India, ligypt, Afrien and the West Indies ; liy virtute of
this control we of the United States can tell Haytians,
Hawaiians and Filipinos how much they shall get for
their Inhor and what shall be done in their lands; hy vir-
tric of this control Belgium can still say to the Congolesc
whether they shall have their hands hacked off or their
cyes gouged out and all without any reference to what
Africans, Asiatics or other infcrior members of the
world's majority may want.
It is thus clear that, as long as the Color Linc exists,
all the perfumed protestations of Demuracy on the pare
of the whitc race must be simply downright lying. 'l'hic
cant of "Democracy" is intender as dust in the cyes of
white voters, incense on the altar of their own self-love.
It furnishics bait for the clever statesmen who hold the
destinies of their people in their hands when they go fishi-
ing for stickers in thc waters of public discussion. But it
becomes more and more apparent that Hindus, ligyptians,
Africans, Chinese and Haytians have taken the measure
of this cant and hypocrisy. And, whatever the white
world may think, it will have these peoples to deal with
during this twentieth century.
In dcaling with them in the past it has been considered

sufficient that the white man should listen to his own
voice alone in (etermining what colored peoples should
have; and he has, therefore, been trying perpetually
to “solve" the problems arising from his own assump-
tion of the role of God. The first and still the simplest
method was to kill them off, either by slaughter pure
and simple, as in the case of the American Indians and
the ('ongo natives, or by forcibly changing their mode of
life, as was done by those pious prudes who killed off the
Tasmanians; or by importing among them rum, gin,
whiskey and consumption, as has been attempted in the
case of the Segroes of Africa and North America. But,
tunlike the red Indians and Tasmanians, most of these
subject peoples have refused to be killed off. Their
vitality is tow strong.
The second method divides itself into internal and
external treatment. The internal treatment consists in
making them work, to develop the resources of their
ancestral lands, not for themselves, but for their white
overlords, so that the national and imperial coffers may
be filled to overflowing, while the Hindu ryot, on six
cents a day, lives down to the level of the imperialist
formula:
"The poor benighted Hindoo,
lle does the best he kin do;
He never aches
for chops and steaks
And for clothes he makes his skin do."
The external treatment consists of girdling them withi
forts and battleships and holding armics in readiness to
fly at their throats upon the least sign of "uppishness" or
"impudience."
Now, this similarity of suffering on the part of colored
folk has given, and is giving, rise to a certain similarity

movement; India, the Swadesha, the All-India Congress,
and the present revolutionary movement which has lit
the fuse of the powder-keg on which Britain sits in India
today: Africa has her Ethiopian Movement which ranges
from the Zulus and Hottentots of the Cape to the Ekoi
of Nigeria ; in short, the darker races, chafing under the
domination of the alien whites, are everywhere showing
a disposition to take Democracy at its word and to win
some measure of it-for themselves,
What part in this great drama of the future are the
Negroes of the Western world to play? The answer is
on the knees of the gods, who often make hash of the
predictions of men. But it is safe to say that, before the
Negroes of the Western world can play any effective part
they must first acquaint themselves with what is taking
place in that larger world whose millions are in motion.
They must keep well informed of the trend of that
motion and of its range and possibilities. If our problem
here is really a part of a great world-wide problem, we
must make our attempts to solve our part link up with
the attempts being made elsewhere to solve the other
parts. So will we profit by a wider experience and per-
haps be able to lend some assistance to that ancient
Mother Land of ours to whom we may fittingly apply
the words of Milton :

the yuestion of the relation between mental competence
and property rights. "Deres inability to govern desirovy
title to ownership?" he asks. The white race sissimes an
affirmative answer in every case in which the national
property of darker and weaker races are concerned and
deny it in cases in which their own national property
interests are involved. It seems strange that whereas the
disturbances occurring in our own southern sintes are
never considercel sufficient to justify the destruction of
their sovereignty, on the other hand, such disturbances
occurring in Hlayti or Mexico are considered a sufficient
reason for invasion and conquest by white Americans.
The same is true of lingland, l'rance and Itwy. Allis-
qurbance in Alexandrin, Delhi, Ashanti or the Cameroons
suſtices to fix upon these territories and citics the ballgames
of inferiority and incompetence to rule themselves. The
conclusion is always drawn in such cases that the white
race has been called by this fortunate combination of
circumstances to do the ruling for them. But similar dis-
turbances occurring in Wales, Essen or Marscilles would
never be considered as sufficient to justify the dictator,
ship of foreign powers in the interest of "law and order."
The truth is that "might makes right" in all these cases.
White statesmon, however, often deny this at the very
nionient when they are using "force without stint, force
to the utmost" to establish "rights" which they claim over
territories, peoples, commerce and the high sens. Their
characteristic hypocrisy keeps them from telling thc
truth as plainly as Von Bernhardi did in his now famous
book, "Germany and the Next War." The “sowiological"
reason for this hypocriny in the fact that they need to

Bolshevism in Barbados.
Among the newspapers in Barbados there is a charm-

signs of awakening observable in those Negroes who

shakes and shivers, throws a few fits, froths at the mouth,

sundry that there is “Bolshevism among Negroes."

Indies. Now the specter which these fools fear is nothing

of varying value. When Mr. Morgan wants to Moat a

stabilize their joint credit and commerce; when areas like
the Belgian Congo are to be handed over to certain rulers

of praisc go up to the gooi of "internationalism" in the
temple of "civilization." But when any portion of the
world's disinherited (whether white or black) seeks to
join hands with other groups in the same condition, then
the lords of misrule denounce the idea of internationalism
as anarchy, sedition. Bolshevism and disruptive propa
ganda.
Why the difference? It is because the international
linking up of peoples is a source of strength to those who
are linked up. Naturally, the overlords want to strengthen
themselves. And, quite as naturally, they wish to keep

their subject masses from strengthening themsclves in the
same way. Today the great world-majority, made up of
black, brown and yellow peoples, are stretching out their
hands to each other and developing a "consciousness of
kinel": as I'rofessor Giddings would call it. They are
sccking to establish their own centers of diffusion for
their own internationalism, and this fact is giving night-
mares to Downing street, the Quni (l'Orsay and other
centers of white capitalist internationalism.
The object of the capitalist international is to imiíy and
standardize the exploitation of black, brown and yellow
peoples in such a way that the danger to the exploiting
groups of cutting each other's throats over the spoils may
be reduced to a minimum. Hence the various agreements.
mandates and spheres of influence. Hence the League of
Nations, which is notoriously not a league of the white
masses, but of their gold-braided governors. Faced by
such a tendency on the part of those who bear the white
man's burden for what they can get out of it, the darker
peoples of the world have begun to realize that their first
duty is to themselves. A similarity of suffering is pro-
lucing in them a similarity of sentimient, and the temper
of that sentiment is not to be mistaken.
To the white statesmen "civilization" is identical with
their own overlordship, with their right and power to
dictate to the darkcr millions what their way of life and
of allegiance shall be. To this the aroused sentiment of
the world's darker majority lemurs. They want to be as
free as England, America or l'rance. They do not wish
to be "warils of the nations" of Furope any longer. And

Can they effect a junction of the two?
Frankly, wc doubt it. Continued suppression may be
fraught with consequences disastrous to white overlorel-
ship. In any case the tendency towarel an international
of the darker races cannot be set back. Incrcasing
enlightenment, the spread of technical science, and the
recently acquired knowledge of the weak points of white
"civilization" gained by the darker peoples during the
recent World War, are enough lo negative such a supe
position. The darker peoples will strive increasingly for
their share of sunlight, and if this is what white "civiliza-
tion" opposes, then white "civilization" is likely to have
a hard time of it.

cently issued by Lothrop Stoddard in his book,
"The Rising Tide of Color." In justice to Mr. Hearst,
it must be pointed out (as we ourselves did in 1916) that
he saw this handwriting on the wall long ago. Mr. Hearst
is not particularly famous as a friend of the darker races;
but one must give him credit for having scen what was
involved in the war between the white nations of Europa
and America. As far back as 1915, the present writer

the stage of human history, there was no civilization or

admonishes us that if it were to pass off the stage as the
controlling factor in the World's destiny, there would be
no civilization or culture remaining. Naturally, we take
exception to both these views, because, for the past, we
know better and, for the future, we think better of the
many peoples who make up the cycle of civilization.
But these conditions are not the gravest at present.
The fact of most tremendous import is that the white race
in trying to settle its own quarrels has called in black,
brown and yellow to do its fighting for it, with the result
that black, brown and yellow will learn thereby how to
fight for themselves, even against those whom they were
called in to assist. The white race cannot escape froin its
vilemma, however. If it were to decree hereafter that
wars lietween whites should be restricted to whites alone,
then we should be given the poignant spectacle of the
white race continuing to cut its own throat while the

I The following article was written in 1918 when the Great
War still rageil. It was written for a certain well known radical
magazine; but was found to be "too radical" for publication at
that time. It is given tow to the Negro public partly because
the underlying explanation which it offers of the root-cause
of the war has not yet received treatment (even among social-
istic radicals) and partly because recent events in China, India,
Africa and the United States have proved the accuracy of its
forecasts 1
lhi Nineteenth Christian Century saw the international ex-
PATINIUII of capitalison---the economic system of the white peoples
of Western Europe and America---and its establishment by
force and fraud over the lands uſ the colored races, black and
brown and yellow. The opening years of the Twentieth Century
present us with the sorry spectacle of these same white nations
enitting cach other's throats to determine which of them shall
enjoy the property which has been acquired. For this is the
real sum and substance of the original "war aims" of the bel-

In the first place, we in America need not leave our own lane
to seek reasons for sixpecting the sincerity of democratic pro-

thousand miles away, millions of Negrocs are disfranchised in
our own land by the "cracker" democracies of the Southern

The horrible hoberitlist of East St. Louis was possible only

1800 Kant St. Louis was simply the climax of a long series
of butcheries perpertrated on defenscless Negroes which has
made the murder rate of Christian America higher than that of
heather Africa and of cvery other civilized land. And, although

United States and defending their lives from civilian aggressors,
not one of the murderers of black men, women and children

wonder that the Negro masses are insisting that before they
can be expected to enthuse over the vagine formula of making
the world "safe for demucracy" they must receive sonic as-
surance that their corner of the world--the South-shall first
be made "nale for democracy!" Who knows but that perhaps
the situation and treatment of the American Negro by (rir own
government and people may have kept the t'rutral l'owers
from believing that we meant to fight for democracy in
Europe, and canned them to persint in a course which has
driven us into this war in which we must spend billions of
Treasure and rivers of blood.
It should acem, then, that "elemocracy," like "kultur," is more
valuable as a battle-cry than as a real beliet to be practised by
those who proſess it. And the plen of "small nationalitics" is

farts of history and has to be toll. for his benefit I present the
fullowing statement from Sir llarry Joluuston, in "The Sphere"
of London. Sir Harry Johnston is the foremost English authority
on Africa and is in a position to know something of imperial
aims.
"Rightly governed, I venture to predict that Africa will, if we
are victorious, repay us and all our allies the cost of our struggle
with Germany and Austria. The war, deny it who may, was
really fought over African questions. The Germans wished, as
the chief gain of victory, to wrest rich Morocco from Frerch
control, to take the French Congo from France, and the Portu-
guese Congo from Portugal, to secure from Belgium the richest
and most' extensive tract of alluvial goldfield as yet discovered.
This is an auriferous region which, properly developed, will, when
war is over, repay the hardest hit of our allies (France) all that
she has lost from the German devastation of her home lands.
The mineral wealth of trans-Zambezian Africa--freed forever,
we will hope, from the German menace--is gigantic; only
slightly exploited so far. Wealth is hidden amid the seem-
ingly unprofitable deserts of the Sahara, Nubia, Somaliland
and Namaqua. Africa, I predict, will eventually show itself
to be the most richly cndowed of all the continents in valu-
able vegetable and mineral substances."
There is the sum and substance of what Schopenhauer would
have called "the sufficient reason" for this war. No word of
"democracy" there, but instead the easy assumption that, as a
matter of course, the lands of black Africa belong to white
Europe and must be apportioned on the good old principle :-
the simple plan,
That he shall take who has the power,
And he must keep who can.'
THE ECONOMICS OF WAR,
It is the same economic motive that has been back of every
modern war since the merchant and trading classes secured con-
trol of the powers of the modern state from the battle of Plassy
to the present world war. This is the natural and inevitable
effect of the capitalist system, of what (for want of a worse
name) we call "Christendom." For that system is based upon
the wage relationship between those who own and those who
operate the gigantic forces of land and machinery. Under this

system no capitalist employs a worker for two dollars a day unless
that worlier creates more than two dollars' worth of wealth for
him. Only out of this surplus can profits comc. If ten million
workers should thus crcate one hundred million dollars' worth
of wealth cach day and get twenty or fifty millions in wages, it is
obvious that they can expend only what they have received, and
that, therefore, every nation whose industrial system is organized
on a capitalist basis must produce a mass of surplus products over
and above, not the need, but the purchasing power of the nation's
producers. Before these products can return to their owners as
profits they must be sold somewhere. Hence the need for foreign
markets, for fields of exploitation and "spheres of influence" in
"undeveloped” countries whose virgin csources are exploited in
their turn after the capitalist fashion. But, since every industrial
nation is seeking the same outlet for its products, clashes are
inevitable and in these clashes beaks and claws--armics and navics
-must come into play. Hence beaks and claws must be pro-
vided beforehand against the day of conflict, and hence the
exploitation of white men in Europe and America becomes
the reason for the exploitation of black and brown and yellow
men in Africa and Asia. And, therefore, it is hypocritical and
absurd to pretend that the capitalist nations can ever intend
to abolish wars. For, as long as black men are exploited by
white men in Africa, so long must white men cut each other's
throats over that exploitation. And thus, the selfish and
ignorant white worker's destiny is determined by the hundreds
of millions of those whom he calls "niggers." "The strong too
often think that they have a mortgage upon the weak; but
in the domain of morals it is the other way."
THE COLOR LINE.
But economic motives have always their social de; and this
exploitation of the lands and labor of colored folk expresses
itself in the social theory of white domination; the theory that
the worst human stocks of Montmartre, Seven Dials and the
Bowery are superior to the best human stocks of Rajputana or
Khartoum. And when these colored folk who make up the over-
whelming majority of this world demand decent treatment for .
themselves, the proponents of this theory accuse them of seeking
social equality. For white folk to insist upon the right to man-
age their own ancestral lands, free from the domination of

tyrants, remestic and foreign, is variously described as "lemoc-
racy" and "self-determination." Por Negroes, Egyptians and
Ilinius to seek the same thing is impudence. What wonder, then,
that the white man's rule is felt by them to rest iipon a secthing
volcano whose slumbering fires are made tip of the hundreds of
millions of Chinese, Japanese, Hindus and Africans! Truly has it
been said that "the problem of the 20th Century is the problem of
the Color Line." And wars are not likely to end ; in fact, they
are likely to be wider and more terrible---so long as this theory
of white domination seeks to hold down the majority of the
world's people under the iron heel of racial repression.
Of course, no sane person will deny that the white race is, at
present, the superior race of the world. I use the word "superior"
in no cloudy, metaphysical sense, but simply to mean that they
are on top and their will goes--at present. Consider this fact
as the pivotal fact of the war. Then, in the light of it, consider
what is happening in Europe today. The white race is superior--
its will gocs--because it has invented and amassed greater mcans
for the subjugation of nature and of man than any other race. It
is the top dog by virtue of its soldiers, guns, ships, money, rc-
sources and brains. Yet there in Europe it is delibertaely burn-
- ing up, consuming and destroying these very soldiers, guns,
ships, money, resources and brains, the very things upon which
its supremacy rests. When this war is over, it will be less able
to enforce its sovereign will upon the darker races of the world.
Does any one believe that it will be as casy to hold down Egypt
and India and Persia after the war as it was before? Hardly.
THE RACIAL RESULTS OF THE WAR.
Not only will the white race be depleted in numbers, but its
quality, physical and mental, will be considerably lowered for a
time. War destroys first the strongest and bravest, the best
stocks, the young men who were to father the next generation,
The next generation must, consequently, be fathered by the
weaker stocks of the race. And thus, in physical stamina and
in brain-power, they will be less equal to the task of holding down
the darker millions of the world than their fathers were. This
was the thought back of Mr. Hearst's objection to our entering
the war. Ile wanted the United States to stand as the white
race's reserve of man-power when Europe had been bled white.
But what will be the effect of all this upon that colored major-

ity whose preponderant existence our newspapers ignore? In
the first place, it will feel the liſting of the pressure as the iron
hand of "discipline" is relaxed. And it will expand, when that
pressure is removed, to the point where it will first ask, then
demand, and finally secure, the right of self-determination. It
will insist that, not only the white world, but the whole world,
be made "sa fc for democracy." This will mcan a self-govern-
ing Egypt, a self-governing India, and independent African states
as large as Germany and France-and larger. And, as a result,
there will come a shifting of the basis of international politics
and business and of international control. This is the living
thought that comes to me from the newspapers and books that
have been written and published by colored men in Africa and
Asia during the past three years. It is what I have heard from
their own lips as I have talked with them. And, yet, of this
thought which is inflaming the international underworld, not a
word appears in the parochial press of America, which seems
to think that if it can keep its own Negroes down to servile lip-
service, it need not face the world-wide problem of the "Conflict
of Color." as Mr. Putnam-Weale calls it..
But that the more intelligent portions of the white world are
becoming distressingly conscious of it, is evident from the first
great manifesto of the Russian Bolsheviki last year when they
asked about Britain's subject peoples.
And the British workingmen have evidently done some think-
ing in their turn. In their latest declarations they seem to see
the ultimate necessity of compelling their own aristocrats to fore-

To sum it all up, the war in Europe is the result of the desire
of the white governments of Europe to exploit for their own
benefit the lands and labor of the darker races, and, as the war
continues, it must decrease the white man's stock of ability to
do this successfully against the wishes of the inhabitants of those
lands. This will result in their freedom from thralldom and thic
extension of political, social, and industrial democracy to the
twelve hundred inillion black and brown and yellow peoples of

mind when he wished to make the world. "safe for democracy."

The Racial Rools of Culture.
Education is the name which we give to that process
by which the ripened generation brings to bear upon the
rising generation the storcd-up knowledge and experi-
ence of the past and present generations to fit it for the
business of life. If we are not to waste money and
energy, our educational systems should shape our youth
for what we intend them to become.
We Negrocs, in a world in which we are the under dog,
must shape our youth for living in such a world. Shall
we shape them mentally to accept the status of uncler-dog
is their predestined lot? Or shall we shape them into
men and women fit for a free world? To do the former
needs nothing more than continuing as we are. To do the
latter is to shape their souls for contimied conflict with a
theory and practice in which most of the white world that
surrounds them are at one.
The educational system in the United States and the
West Indies was shaped by white people for white youth,"
and from their point of view, it fits their purpose well.
Into this system came the children of Negro parents when
chattel slavery was ended—and their relation to the prob-
lems of life was obviously different. The white boy and
girl draw cxclusively from the stored-up knowledge and
experience of the past and present generations of whitc
people to fit them for the business of being dominant
whites in a world full of coloreil folk. The examples of
valor and virtue on which their minds are feel are cx-
clusively white examples. What wonder, then, that cach
generation comes to maturity with the idea imbedded in
its mind that only white men are valorous and fit to rule
and only white women are virtuous and entitled to
chivalry, respect and protection? What wonder that they

nationally and internationally, is that of an inferior.: 11
is only what we should naturally expect.
But what seems to escape attention is the fact that the
Negro boy and girl, getting the same (though worse) in-
struction, also get from it the same notion of the Negro's
place and part in life which the white children get. Is
it any wonder, then, that they so readily accept the status
of inferiors; that they tend to disparage themselves, and
think themselves worth while only to the extent to wliich
they look and act and think like the whites? They know
nothing of the stored-up knowledge and experience of
the past and present generations of Negroes in their an-
cestral lands, and conclude there is no such store of
knowledge and experience. They readily accept the as-
sumption that Negroes have never been anything but
slaves and that they never had a glorious past as other
fallen peoples like the Grecks and Persians have. And
this despite the mass of collected testimony in the works
of Barth, Schweinfurth, Mary Kingsley, Lady Lugard,
Morel, Ludolphus, Blyden, Ellis, Ratzel, Kidd, Es-Saadi,
Casely Hayford and a host of others, Negro and white.
A large part of the blame for this deplorable condi-
tion must be put upon the Negro colleges like Howard,
Hisk, Livingstone and Lincoln in the United States, and
Codrington, Harrison and the Mico in the West Indies.
These are the institutions in which our cultural ideals
and educational systems are fashioned for the shaping of
the minds of the future generations of Negroes. It can-
not be expected that it shall begin with the common
schools ; for, in spite of logic, cducational ideas and ideals
sprend from above downwards. If we are ever to enter
into the confraternity of colored peoples it should seem
the duty of our Negro colleges to drop their silly smat.

cxperts of white America were at odds with ours on the samc
subject; now, however, ours seem to be at odds among them-

CHAPTER NINE.
A FEW BOOKS.
The Negro in History and Civilization
(From Superman to Man, by J. A. Rogers.)
This volume by Mr. Rogers is the greatest little book on the
Negro that we remember to have read. It makes no great
parade of being "scientific,” as so many of our young writers
do who scem to think that science consists solely in logical
analysis. If science consists fundamentally of facts, of informa-
tion and of principles derived from those facts, then the volume
before us is one of the most scientific that has been produced by
a Negro writcr. It sweeps the circle of all the social sciences.
History, sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics and poli-
tics--even thcology-are laid umder contribution and yield
store of information which is worked up into a pre-
sentation plain and clear that the simplest can read
and understand it, and yet so fortificd by proofs from the greatest
standard authorities of the past and present that there is no
joint in its armor in which the keenest spear of a white scientist
may enter.
Unlike an older type of scholar (now almost extinct) the
author does not go to vapid verbal philosophers or devotional
dreamers for the facts of history and ethnology. He goes to
historians and ethnologists for them and to anthropologists for
his anthropology. The result is Information which stands the
searching tests of any inquirer who chooses to doubt and in-
vestigate before accepting what is set before him.
From this book the unlearned reader of the African race
can gather proof that his race has not always been a subject
or inferior race. He has the authority of Professor Reisner,
of Harvard; of Felix Dubois, Volney, Herodotus, Finot, Sergi,
the modern Egyptologists and the scholars of the white world who
ussembled at the Universal Races Congress in London in 1911,

for the belief that his race has founded great civilizations, has
ruled over arcas its large as all Europe, and was prolific in states-
inen, scientists, poets, conquerors, religious and political leaders,
arts and crafts, industry and cominerce when the white race was
wallowing in barbarism or unk in savagery. Here he can learn
on good authority, from St. Jerome and Cicero, Herodotus and
I lumer down to the modern students of race history, that canni-
balism has been a practise among white populations like the
Scythians, Scots and Britons; that the white races have been
slaves; that here in America the slavery of white men was a
fact as late as the 19th century, and "according to Professor
Cigrand, Grover ('leveland's grandfather, Richard Falley, was an
Irish slave in Connecticut," In short, he will Icarn here, not that
nie wspaper science which keeps even "educated" Americans so
complacently ignorant, but the science of the scientists themi-
selves. : He will learn all that this kind of science has to tell of
the relative capacity and standing of the black and white races-
and much of it will surprise him. But all of it will please and in-
struct.
The book also deals with the facts of the present position of
the Negro in America and the West Indies; with questions of
religion, education, politics and political parties, war work,
lynching, miscegenation on both sides, the beauty of Negro
women and race prejudice. And on everyone of these topics
it gives a ininimuin of opinion and a maximum of information.
This information flows forth during the course of a scries of dise
cussions between an educated Negro Pullman porter and a
Southern white statesman on a train running between Chicago
and San Francisco. The superior urbanity of the Negro, coupled
with his wider information and higher intelligence, eventually
wilis over the Caucasian to admit that the whole mental attitude
of himself and his race in regard to the Negru was wrong and
based on nothing better than prejudice.
This conversational device gives the author an opportunity to
present all the conflicting views on both sides of the Color Line,
and the result is a wealth or information which makes this book
a necessity on the bookshell of everyone, Negro or Caucasian,
who has some use for knowledge on the subject of the Negro.
The book is published by the author at 4700 State Street,
Chicago.

"Darkwater."
.By W. E. B. Du Bois.
An unwritten law has existed for a long time to the effect
that the critical estimates which fix the status of a book by a
Negro author shall be written by white men. Praise or blame-
the elementary criticism which expresses only the reviewer's
feelings in reference to the book-has generally been the sole
function of the Negro critic. And the results have not been
good. For, in the first place, white critics (except in music).
have been loo prone to judge the product of a Negro author as
Dr. Johnson judged the dancing dog : "It isn't at all like dancing ;
but then, one shouldn't expect more from a dog." That is
why many Negro pocts of fifth grade mcrit are able to marshali
ecomiums by the bushel from friendly white critics who ought
to know better. On the other hand, there is the danger of
disparagement arising solely from racial prejudice and the
Caucasian refusal to take Negro literary products seriously:
In either casc thc work fails to secure consideration sulely
on its merits. Wherefore, it is high time that competent ap-
praisal of Negro books should come from "our side of the
street." But, then, the Negro rcading public should be taught
what to expect, viz., that criticism is neither "knocking" nor
"boosting"; but an attempt, in the first place, to furnish a correct
and adequate idea of the scope and literary method of the book
linder review, of the author's success in realizing his objects, and
of the spirit in which he does his work. In the second place,
the critic should be expected to bring his own understanding of
the subject matter of the book to bear upon the problem of
enlightening the readers' understanding, that at the end the
reader may decide whether the work is worth his particular
while.
'This book of Dr. Du Bois' is one which challenges the swing
of seasoned judgment and appraisal. It challenges also free
thinking and plain mpcaking. For at the very cutsct,
we find ourselves forced to demur to the publishers'
assumptions as to its author's status. "Even more than
the late Booker Washington, Mr. Du Bois io now chief
spokesman of the two hundred million men and women of

Aiman blived." So say the publishers or the inithor.
This is outrageously untrue. Once upon a time Dr. Du Bois
held a sort of spiritual primacy among The Talented Tenth, 110t
at all comparable to that of Booker Washington in scope, but
yital and compelling for all that. The power of that leadership,
however, instead of increasing since Mr. Washington's death,
has decreased, and is now openly flouted by the most active and
outspoken members of The Talented Tenth in Negro America.
And, outside of the twelve or fifteen millions of African blood"
in the United States, the mass of that race in South and West
Africa, Egypt and the Philippines know, unfortunately, very
little of Dr. Du Bois. It may be, however, that this is merely
a publishers' rhodomontade.
And it is the publishers themselves who challenge for this
volume a comparison with "The Souls of Black Folk," which
was published by McClurg in 1903. It is regrettable that they
should force the issue, for "The Souls of Black Folk" is a
greater book than "Darkwater" in many ways. In the first
place, its high standard of craitsmanship is maintained through
every chapter and page. There are no fag-ends, as in the chapter
"Of Beauty and Death" in the present volume, where the rhetoric
bogs down, the author loses the thread of his purpose and
goes spieling off into space, spinning a series of incongruous
purple patches whose tawdry glitter shows the same reversion
to crude barbarism in taste which leads a Florida fieldhand to
don opal-colored trousers, a pink tie, pari-colored shirt and
yellow shoes, Artistically, that chapter is an awful thing, and
I trust that the author is artist enough to be ashamed of it.
And, though it may savor of anti-climax, “The Souls of
Black Folk" was more artistically "gotten" up-to use the gram-
mar of its author. "Darkwater" is cheaply bound and cheaply
printed on paper which is almost down to the level of the Sea.
side Library. Neither in mechanical nor mental quality does the
book of 1920 come up to the level oi that of 1903.
Yet; in spite of some defects, "Darkwater" (with the excep-
tion of chapters six, scven, cight and nine) is a book well worth
reading. It is a collection of papers written at different times,
between 1908 and 1920, and strung loosely on the string of race.
One wishes that the author could have included his earlier essay
on The Talented Tenth and his address on the aims and ideals

of modern cducation, delivered some twelve years ago to the
colored school children of Washington, D. C.
Each paper makes a separate chapter, and each chapter is
followed by a rhetorical sprig of symbolism in prose or verse in
which the tone-color of the preceding piece is made manifest
to the reader. Of these tone-poems in prosc and verse, the best
are the Credo; A Litany at Atlanta; The Riddle of the Sphinx.
and Jesus Christ in Texas. In these the lyrical quality of the
author's prosc is liſted to high levels. In these clegance does
not slop over into turgid declamation and rhetorical claptrap-
which has become a common fault of the author's recent prose
as shown in The Crisis. In this, the first part of the book, the
work is genuire and its rhetoric rings truc. Nevertheless, the
sustained artistic swing of "The Souls of Black Folk," which
placed that work (as a matter of form and style) on the level
of Edgar Saltus' lmperial Purple—this is not attained in "Dark-
water."
The book may be said to deal largely with the broad inter-
national aspects of the problem of the color line and its re-
actions on statecraft, welt-politik, international peace and inter-
national trade, industry, cducation and the brotherhood of man.
Each chapter, or paper, is devoted to one of these reactions.
Then there is a charming autobiographical paper, "The Shadow
of Years," which first appeared in The Crisis about three years
ago, in which we have the study of a soul by itself. The growth
of the author's mind under the bewildering shadow cast by the
color line is tragically set forth. I say tragically with delibera-
tion; for what we see here, despite its fine disguise, is the
sinoldering resentment of a mulatto who finds the beckoning
white doors of the world barred on his approach. One senses
the thought that, if they had remained open, the gifted spirit
would have entered and inade his home within them. Mais, chacun
a son gout, and no one has the right to quarrel with the author
on that doubtful scorc.
In the chapter on "The Souls of White Folk" we have a
fine piece, not so much of analysis, as of exposition. The author
puts his best into it. And yet that best seems to have failed to
bite with acid brutality into the essential iron of the white
inan's soul. For the basic elements of that soul are Hypocrisy,
Greed and Cruelty. True, the author brings this out; but hic

for the white man, only in print; whereas it might have been
inade in other forms which come nearer to his self-love. Neverthe-
less it is umanswerable in its logic.
In "The Hands of Ethiopia," as in "The Souls of White Folk,"
we catch the stern note of that threat which (disguise it as
our journals willi, the colored races are making, of an ultimate
appeal in tcrins of color and race to the white man's only God-
the God of Armed Force. But the author never reaches the
height of that newer thought-an international alliance of
Black, Brown and Yellow against the arrogance of White.
In "Work and Wealth" and "The Servant in the House" the
problems of work and its reward, and the tragedy of that reward,
are grippingly set forth in relation to the Negro in America and
in the civilized world. "The Ruling of Men" is followed
by three papers of very infcrior merit and the book ends with a
fantastic short story, "The Comet" which, like "The Coming of
John" in "The Souls of Black Folk," suggests that Dr. Du Bois
could be a compelling writer of this shorter form of fiction.
The touch in this story of incident is light, but arresting.
Dr. Du Bois, ill the looseness of phrase current in our time
in America, is called a scholar- on what groumds we are not
inforined. But Dr. Du Bois is not a scholar; his claim to con-
sideration reste tipon a different basis, but one 110 less high.
And when the Negro culture of the next century shall assay
the products of our own it will scem remarkable that this su-
preme wizard of words, this splendid literary artist, should
have left his own demesne to claim the crown of scholarship.
Surely, there is honest credit cnonxh in being what he is, our
foremost man of culture. And this "Darkwater," despite its
lapses from artistic grace, helps to rivet his claim to that con-
sideration. It is a book which will well repay reading.
The Rising Tide of Color Against While World Supremacy.

to the fact that they were acting as their own grave diggers

1bout the same time Mr. Melville 8 Stone, president of the
Associated Press, in an address before the Quill Club ou “Racc
Prejudice in the Far East" reinforced the same grisly truth. Five
years later “T. Shirby Hodge" wrote "The White Man's Burden:
A Satirical Forecast," and ended it with these pregnant words:
“The white man's burden is--himself." His publishers practically
suppressed his book, which, by the way, should have been in the
library of cvery intelligent Negro. The white world was indis-
posed then to listen to its voices of warning. But today the
physical, economic and racial ravages of the World War have
so changed the white world's mind that within four weeks of its
appearance "The Rising Tide of Color Against White World
Supremacy," by Lothrop Stoddard, has struck the bull's-eye of
attention and has already become the most widely talked-of book
of the year. White men of power are discussing its facts and
its conclusions with bated breath and considerable disquietude.
Here is a book written by a white man which causes white men
to shiver. For it calls their attention to the writing on the wall.
It proves that the white race in its mad struggle for dominion
over others has been exhausting its vital resoures and is exhaust-
ing them further. It proves to the hilt the thesis advanced in 1917
in my brief essay on "The White War and the Colored Races"
that, whereas the white race was on top by virtue of its guns, ships,
money, intellcct and masscd man-power, in the World War it
was busy burning up, depicting and destroying these very re-
sources on which its primacy depended. But even thongh the
white capitalists knew all this their mad greed was still their
master. This great race is still so low spiritually that it sells
even its racial integrity for dollars and cents. Mr. Stoddard's
book may disturb itx sense of security for a brief space, but
it cannot keep white "civilization" from its mad dance of death.
"What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose
his own soul?" And the white race will finally find that this
is even more truc racially than individunlly.
We have noticed for many years that whereas domestic jour-
nalism was merely journalism--the passing register of parochial
sensations-the journalism of the international publicists like
Lord Bryce, Meredith Townsend, Archibald Colquhoon, Putnam
Wcale and Hyndman was something more solid than journallam.

The prexerit volume is one of the best of the former and is full of
the qualities of its class. But at the very outset it suffers from
the unwelcome assistance of Dr. Madison Grant, "chairman of the
New York Zoological Society and trustee of the American
Museum of Natural History," Dr. Grant has accumulated a
large stock of musty ethnological ideas of which he unburdens
hiniself in what he evidently intends as a "learned" introduction,
without which freightage the book would be inuch better. The
difference in value and accuracy between Mr. Stoddard's text and
the pseudo-scientific introduction of Dr. Grant would furnish
fair material for philosophic satire. Unfortunately we cannot
indulge the inclination in the columns of a weekly newspaper,
Dr Girant, in owlisht innocence, splutters out the usual futile
fully which (in other donnina) has brought the white race to
the frontiers of the present crisis. He reads back into history
the racial values of today and trails the Anglo-Saxon's crass con-
ceit und arrogance across the pages of its record, finding "con-
traxt of mental and spiritual endowments
clusive of
definition," and other racial clap-trap whose falsity has been
demonstrated again and again by warm-hearted enthusiasts like
Jean limot and coldly critical and scientific scholars like Dr.
Taylor ("Origin of the Aryans"), Sergi ("The Mediterrancan
Race") and J. M. Kobertson ("The Evolution of States"). But
one can forgive Dr. Grant; he is a good American, and good
Americans (especially "scientists" on race) are usually fifty
years behind the Englisli, who, in turn, are usually twenty years
behind the Germans. Dr. Grant's annexation of the past history
of human culture to the swollen record of the whites sounds
Wood-even if it smells bad. And he is in good Anglo-Saxon
company. Sir Harry Johnston does the same thing and gets titles
(scientific and other) by so doing. The Englishman takes the
very Egyptinns, Hindus and tribal Liberians, whom he would
call "niggers" in New York nnd London, and as soon as he finds
that they have done anything worth while he ings them with a
"white" tag.. Thus, to the professional "scientist" like Dr. Grant,
living in the parochial atmosphere of the United States, science
is something arcane, recondite and off the earth; while to the

organized daily knowledge and cominon sense. Thus journalists,
good and bad, are the ones who form opinion in America: be.
cause "scientists" are so distressingly stupid.
Mr. Stoddard's thesis starts from the proposition that of thc
seventeen hundred million people on our carth today the great
majority is made up of black, brown, red and yellow people. The
white race, being in the ininority, still dominates over the lands
of black, brown, red and (in the case of China) has assumed
a right of dictatorship and disposal cven' in the yellow man's
lands. In the course of this dictatorship and domination the
white race has crected the barrier of the color line to keep the
other races in their place. But this barrier is cracking and giving
way at many points and the food of racial self-assertion, hitherto
dammed nip, threatens to overflow the outer and Inner dikes and
sweep away the dominntion of the whites.
The author approaches his theme with a curiously graduated
respect for other races. This respect, while it is a novelty in the
attitude of the blond overlords, is alwnys in direct proportion
to the present power and discerniblc potcntialities of the races
discussed. For the yellow man of Japan and China he shows
the greatest deference. The browns (of Indin, Persia, Afghani
stan, Erypt and the Mohammedan world in general) are, wil
course, inferior, but must be respected for their militancy. .The
reds (the original American stock which is the backbone of the
population of Mexico, Central sind South America) are a source
of contamination for white blood and an infernal nuisance,
onpable of uniting with Japan and China in an onslaught on the
land areas reserved for white exploitation in the western world:
while the blacks, at the foot of the ladder, have never amounted
to anything, don't amount to anything now, and can never
seriously menace the superiority of the whites.
The gradation is full of meaning, especially to those fervid
theorists who affect to belleve that religion, morality, loyalty and
good citizenship constitute « food claim to the white man's
respect. For it is Japan's actual military night and China's
impending military might which have put them in Grade A,
while the brown man's show of resistance in Egypt, Indin
and clarwhere under Islam, and his general physical imrest and

active discontent have secured for him a classification in Grade
Bi "The American in Mexico and South America keeps his wint-
dow opon toward the cast; but the black man still seems, in our
author's eyes, to be the same loyal, gentie, stupid beast of hurden
that the white man's history has known--except in those parts
of Africa in which he has accepted the Mohammedan religion and
thus become a part of the potential terror of the Moslem world.
In this we think our author mistaken; but, after all, it is ncither
arginnents nor logic that will determine these matters, but deeds
and accomplishments.
But, however his racial respect may be apportioned, Mr. Stento
dard holds that his race is doomed. "If the present drift be not
changed we whites are all ultimately dooined. Unless we set our
house in order the doom will sooner or later overtake us all."
The present revicwer stakes his money on "the doom," for the

inheres in their very nature. They are so singularly constituted.
that they would rather tear theinsclves to picces parading as the
lords of creation than see any other people achieve an equal

In the pages of this book the author presents many chastening
truths and wide vistas of international politics which are enlight-
ening when carefully studied. But it is not our intent to cover the
entire field of his work, and we think that we have said enough
to indicate the high value and suggestiveness of the work. But
we may be allowed to point out that all the way through the
author, though clear and enlightened, remains an unreconstructed
Anglo-Saxoni, desirous of opening the eyes of his race to the
dangers which beset them through their racial injustice and
arrogance; but sternly, resolutely, intent that they shall not
share their overlordship with any other of the sons of earth.

The Black Man's Burden
(A Reply to Kudyard Kipling.)

Take up the Black Man's burden-
Send forth the worst ye breed,
And bind our sons in shackles
To serve your selfish greed;
To wait in heavy harness
Be-devilled and beguiled
Until the Fates reimse you
From a world you have defiled.
Take up the Black Man's burden
Your lies may still abide
To vcil the threat of terror
And check our racial pride;
Your cannon, church and courthoune
May still our sons constrain
To acck the white man's profit
And work the white man's gain.
Take up the Black Man's hurden-
Reach out and hog the carth,
And leave your workers hungry
In the country of their birth;
Then, when your goal is ncarest,
The end for which you fought,
Watch other's trained efficiency
Bring all your hope to naught.
Take up the Black Man's burden-
Reduce their chiefs and kings
To toll of Acrf and sweeper
The lot of common things :
Sodden their poil with slaughter,
Ravish their lands with lead :
Go, sign them with your living
And seal them with your dead.
