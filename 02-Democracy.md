## CHAPTER II.<BR>DEMOCRACY AND RACE FRICTION

### The East St. Louis Horror

This nation is now at war to make the world “safe for
democracy,” but the Negro’s contention in the court of
public opinion is that until this nation itself is made safe
for twelve million of its subjects the Negro, at least, will
refuse to believe in the democratic assertions of the country. 
The East St. Louis pogrom gives point to this
contention. Here, on the eve of the celebration of the
Nation’s birthday of freedom and equality, the white
people, who are denouncing the Germans as Huns and
barbarians, break loose in an orgy of unprovoked and
villainous barbarism which neither Germans nor any other
civilized people have ever equalled.

How can America hold up its hands in hypocritical
horror at foreign barbarism while the red blood of the
Negro is clinging to those hands? so long as the President
and Congress of the United States remain dumb in the
presence of barbarities in their own land which would tip
their tongues with righteous indignation if they had been
done in Belgium, Ireland or Galicia?

And what are the Negroes to do? Are they expected
to re-echo with enthusiasm the patriotic protestations of
the boot-licking leaders whose pockets and positions
testify to the power of the white man’s gold? Let there
be no mistake. Whatever the Negroes may be compelled
by law to do and say, the resentment in their hearts will
not down. Unbeknown to the white people of this land
a temper is being developed among Negroes with which
the American people will have to reckon.

At the present moment it takes this form: If white
men are to kill unoffending Negroes, Negroes must kill
white men in defense of their lives and property. This is
the lesson of the East St. Louis massacre.

The press reports declare that, “the troops who were
on duty during the most serious disturbances were ordered 
not to shoot.” The civil and military authorities
are evidently winking at the work of the mobs&mdash;horrible
as that was&mdash;and the Negroes of the city need not look
to them for protection. They must protect themselves.
And even the United States Supreme Court concedes
them this right.

There is, in addition, a method of retaliation which we
urge upon them.

It is one which will hit those white men
who have the power to prevent lawlessness just where
they will feel it most, in the place where they keep their
consciences&mdash;the pocket-book. Let every Negro in East
St. Louis and the other cities where race rioting occurs
draw his money from the savings-bank and either bank
it in the other cities or in the postal savings bank. The
only part of the news reports with which we are well
pleased is that which states that the property loss is
already estimated at a million and a half of dollars.

Another reassuring feature is the one suppressed in
most of the news dispatches. We refer to the evidences
that the East St. Louis Negroes organized themselves
during the riots and fought back under some kind of
leadership. We Negroes will never know, perhaps, how
many whites were killed by our enraged brothers in East
St. Louis. It isn’t the news-policy of the white newspapers
(whether friendly or unfriendly) to spread such news
broadcast. It might teach Negroes too much. But we
will hope for the best.

The occurrence should serve to enlarge rapidly the
membership of The Liberty League of Negro-Americans
which was organized to take practical steps to help our
people all over the land in the protection of their lives
and liberties.  &mdash;July 4th, 1917.

### “Arms and the Man” 

In its editorial on “The East St. Louis Horror” *The
Voice* said:

> How can America hold up its hands in hypocritical horror at
foreign barbarism while the red blood of the Negro is clinging
to those hands? So long as the President and Congress of the
United States remain dumb in the presence of barbarities in their
own land which would tip their tongues with righteous indignation
if they had been done in Belgium, Ireland or Galicia?

> And what are the Negroes to do? Are they expected to re-echo
with enthusiasm the patriotic protestations of the boot-licking
leaders whose pockets and positions testify to the power of the
white man’s gold? Let there be no mistake. Whatever the
Negroes may be compelled by law to do and say, the resentment
in their hearts will not down. *Unbeknown to the white people
of this land a temper is being developed among Negroes with
which the American people will have to reckon.*

> *At the present moment it takes this form: If white men are to
kill unoffending Negroes, Negroes must kill white men in defence
of their lives and property. This is the lesson of the East St.
Louis massacre.*

To this, the New York *Age* makes reply in two ways.
Its editor, in an interview given to the *Tribune*, declares
that:

> The representative Negro does not approve of radical socialistic 
outbursts, such as calling upon the Negroes to defend themselves against the whites.

And in its editorial of last week it insists that:

> No man, or woman either, for that matter, is a friend to the
race, who publicly advises a resort to violence to redress the
wrongs and injustices to which members of the race are subjected 
in various sections of the country at the present time.

> The Negro race is afflicted with many individuals whose wagging 
tongues are apt to lead them into indiscreet utterances that
reflect upon the whole race. ... The unruly tongues should
not be allowed to alienate public sympathy from the cause of the
oppressed.

Now, although *The Voice* seeks no quarrel with *The
Age*, we are forced to dissent from this cringing, obsequious
view which it champions. And we do this on
the ground that cringing has gone out of date, that *The
Age’s* view does not now represent any influential or
important section of Negro opinion. The group which
once held that view went to pieces when Dr. Washington
died. The white papers in their news items of last week
gave instance after instance showing that Negroes not
only counselled self-defense, but actually practiced it.
(And *The Age*, by the way, was the only *Negro* paper
in New York City which excluded these items from its news
columns.) If the press reports are correct, then *The
Voice* told the simple truth when it spoke of the new
temper which was being developed “unbeknown to the
white people of this land.” And an outsider might conclude 
that *The Voice* was a better friend to the white
people by letting them know this, than The Age was by
trying to lie about it.

But the controversy goes much deeper than the question
of candor and truthfulness. *The Age* and *The Voice*
join issue on this double question: Have Negroes a right
to defend themselves against whites? Should they defend
themselves? (And this, of course, means violence.) *The
Voice* answers, “Yes!” *The Age* answers “No!” Who is
to decide? Let us appeal to the courts. Every law-book
and statute-book, every court in the civilized world and
in the United States agree that every *human* being has the
legal as well as moral right to kill those who attack and
try to kill him. Then the question for *The Age* to decide,
is whether Negroes are human beings. To call our view
“socialistic” is to call the courts “socialistic,” and displays
an amazing ignorance both of Socialism and of human
nature.

Before we leave this question, it is proper to consider
the near and remote consequences of the radical view.
*The Age* says that unruly tongues will alienate public
sympathy from the oppressed. Good God! Isn’t it high
time to ask of what value is that kind of sympathy which
is ready to be alienated as soon as Negroes cease to be
“niggers” and insist on being men? Is that the sort of
sympathy on which *The Age* has thrived? Then we will
have none of it.

And, as to the remoter consequences: neither we nor
*The Age* has a lease on the future. We can but prophesy.
But intelligent people reach the unknown via the known,
and prophesy the future from the known past and present.
And we do know that no race or group of people past or
present ever won to the status of manhood among men
by yielding up that right which even a singed cat will not
yield up&mdash;the right to defend their lives. If *The Age*
knows of any instance to the contrary in the history of the
past seven thousand years, let it mention that instance.
But *The Age* may ask:

“What will self defense accomplish?” Let us see first
what the absence of self-defense accomplishes. In its
news account of the St. Louis massacre, the *Amsterdam
News* shows that whenever the white mobs found a group
of Negroes organized and armed, *they turned back*;
while *The Age* itself had this significant and pathetic sentence:

> Since the massacre, which will go down in history alongside the
atrocities committed in Brussels and Rheims, a delegation of
Negroes has held a conference with Governor Lowden at Springfield, 
*but the outcome of this meeting will not bring back the lives
of those who, for no valid reason, were struck down and murdered 
in cold blood.*

Taking the two things together the answer seems clear
enough. When murder is cheap murder is indulged in
recklessly; when it is likely to be costly it is not so readily
indulged in. Will *The Age* venture to deny this? No? Then
we say, let Negroes help to make murder costly, for by
so doing they will aid the officers of the city, state and
nation in instilling respect for law and order into the
minds of the worst and lowest elements of our American
cities. And we go further: We say that it is not alone
the brutality of the whites&mdash;it is also the cowardice of
Negroes and the lickspittle leadership of the last two
decades which, like *The Age*, told us to “take it all lying
down”&mdash;it is this which has been the main reason for our
“bein’ so aisily lynched,” as Mr. Dooley puts it.

Whatever *The Age* may say, Negroes will fight back as
they are already fighting back. And they will be more
highly regarded&mdash;as are the Irish&mdash;because of fighting
back.

We are aiming at the white man’s respect&mdash;not at his
sympathy. We cannot win that respect by any conspicuous 
and contemptible cowardice; the only kind of
sympathy which we may win by that is the kind of
sympathy which men feel for a well-kicked dog which
cringes while they kick it.

“Rights are to be won by those who are ready and willing
to fight, if necessary, to have those rights respected.”

Who says this? Theodore Roosevelt. So does President
Wilson. So does the U. S. Government. That is why
we went to war with Germany. Our country always acts
upon the best and highest principle and we Negroes have
just begun to see that our country is quite right. Therefore, 
we are willing to follow its glorious example. That
is all.

<hr class="tb">
### The Negro and the Labor Unions

There are two kinds of labor unionism; the A.F. of L.
kind and the other kind. So far, the Negro has been
taught to think that all unionism was like the unionism
of the American Federation of Labor, and because of this
ignorance, his attitude toward organized labor has been
that of the scab. For this no member of the A.F. of L.
can blame the Negro. The policy of that organization
toward the Negro has been damnable. It has kept him
out of work and out of the unions as long as it could;
and when it could no longer do this it has taken him in,
tricked him, and discriminated against him.

On the other hand, the big capitalists who pay low
wages (from the son of Abraham Lincoln in the Pullman
Co. to Julius Rosenwald of the Sears Roebuck Co.)
have been rather friendly to the Negro. They have given
their money to help him build Y.M.C.A.’s and schools
of a certain type. They have given him community help
in Northern cities and have expended charity on him&mdash;
and on the newspapers and parsons who taught him.
Small wonder, then, that the Negro people are anti-union.

Labor unions were created by white working men that
they might bring the pressure of many to bear upon the
greedy employer and make him give higher wages and
better living conditions to the laborer. When they, in
turn, become so greedy that they keep out the majority
of working people, by high dues and initiation fees, they
no longer represent the interests of the laboring class.
They stand in the way of this class’s advancement&mdash;*and
they must go*. They must leave the way clear for the 20th
century type of unionism which says: “To leave a single
worker out is to leave something for the boss to use
against us. Therefore we must organize in One Big
Union of all the working-class.” This is the type of
unionism which organized, in 1911, 18,000 white and
14,000 black timber workers in Louisiana. This is the
I.W.W. type of unionism, and the employers use their
newspapers to make the public believe that it stands for
anarchy, violence, law-breaking and atheism, because they
know that if it succeeds it will break them.

This type of unionism wants Negroes&mdash;not because its
promoters love Negroes&mdash;but because they realize that
they cannot win if any of the working class is left out;
and after winning they cannot go back on them because
they could be used as scabs to break the unions.

The A.F. of L., which claims a part of the responsibility 
for the East St. Louis outrage, is playing with fire.
The American Negro may join hands with the American
capitalist and scab them out of existence. And the editor
of *The Voice* calls upon Negroes to do this. We have
stood the American Federation of Labor just about long
enough. Join hands with the capitalists and scab them
out of existence&mdash;not in the name of scabbery, but in the
name of a real organization of labor. Form your own
unions (the A.C.E. is already in the field) and make a
truce with your capitalist enemy until you get rid of this
traitor to the cause of labor. Offer your labor to capitalism 
if it will agree to protect you in your right to labor&mdash;and 
see that it does. Then get rid of the A.F. of L.

The writer has been a member of a party which stood
for the rights of labor and the principle of Industrial
Unionism (the 20th century kind). He understands the
labor conditions of the country and desires to see the
working man win out. But his first duty, here as everywhere, 
is to the Negro race. And he refuses to put ahead
of his race’s rights a collection of diddering jackasses
which can publicly palliate such atrocities as that of East
St. Louis and publicly assume, as Gompers did, responsibility 
for it. Therefore, he issues the advice to the workers 
of his race to “can the A.F. of L.” Since the A.F.
of L. chooses to put Race before Class, let us return the
compliment.

### Lynching: Its Cause and Cure

Last week we had occasion to comment on the resignation 
of Mr. John R. Shillady from the secretaryship of
the N.A.A.C.P. Mr. Shillady’s statement accompanying 
his resignation contains these significant words:&mdash;

“I am less confident than heretofore of the speedy success 
of the association’s full program and of the probability 
of overcoming within a reasonable period the forces
opposed to Negro equality by the means and methods
which are within the association’s power to employ.” 

That the N.A.A.C.P. is not likely to affect the lynchings 
in this land can be seen with half an eye by any one
who will note that Governor J. A. Burnquist of Minnesota 
“is also president of the St. Paul branch of the association 
and one of the staunch supporters of its work”;
that the Minnesota lynching of last week was one of the
most cynically brutal that has occurred North or South in
the last ten years, and that the association has offered
and is offering to give the Governor all the assistance
possible.

In most of the other cases of lynchings it is assumed
that all the officials were in collusion with the forces of
violence, or were at any rate in acquiescence. In the present 
case, however, the Governor of the State is himself a
high officer of the association. Yet we venture to
prophesy that no more will be done in the case of the
Minnesota lynchings than in the case of lynchings further
south.

This leads us to a front face consideration of the
problem of lynching. Why do white men lynch black men
in America? We are not dealing here with the original
historical cause; nor even with its present social application. 
We are considering merely the efficient cause.
White men lynch black men or any other men because
those men’s lives are unprotected either by the authorities
of the commonwealth or by the victims themselves.
White men lynch Negroes in America because Negroes’
lives are cheap. So long as they so remain, so long will
lynching remain an evil to be talked about, written about,
petitioned against and slobbered over. But not all the
slobber, the talk or the petitions are worth the time it
takes to indulge in them, so far as the saving of a single
Negro life is concerned.

What, then, is the cure? The cure follows from the
nature of the cause. Let Negroes determine that their
lives shall no longer be cheap; but that they will exact
for them as high a price as any other element in the community 
under similar circumstances would exact. Let
them see to it that their lives are protected and defended,
if not by the State, then certainly by themselves. Then
we will see the cracker stopping to take counsel with himself 
and to think twice before he joins a mob in whose
gruesome holiday sport he himself is likely to furnish one
of the casualties.

“Let Negroes help to make murder costly, for by so
doing they will aid the officers of the city, State and
nation in instilling respect for law and order into the
minds of the worst and lowest elements of our American
cities.” The law of every State says explicitly that killing
in defense of one’s own life is strictly proper, legal and
justifiable. Therefore, if Negroes determine to defend
themselves from the horrible outrage of lynching they
should have the support of every official and every citizen
who really believes in law and order and is determined to
make the law of the land stand as a living reality among
the people that made it. &mdash;July, 1920.
