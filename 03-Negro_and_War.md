## CHAPTER III.<BR>THE NEGRO AND THE WAR

[While the war lasted those of us who saw unpalatable truths
were compelled to do one of two things: either tell the truth as
we saw it and go to jail, or camouflage the truth that we had
to tell. The present writer told the truth for the most part, in so
far as it related to our race relations; but, in a few cases
camouflage was safer and more effective. That camouflage,
however, was never of that truckling quality which was accepted
by the average American editor to such a nauseating degree. I
was well aware that Woodrow Wilson's protestations of democracy
were lying protestations, consciously and deliberately
designed to deceive. What, then, was my duty in the face of
that fact? I chose to pretend that Woodrow Wilson meant
what he said, because by so doing I could safely hold up to contempt
and ridicule the undemocratic practices of his administration
and the actions of his white countrymen in regard to the
Negro. How this was done is shown in the first two editorials
of the following chapter.]

### Is Democracy Unpatriotic?

The present administration is all right. But it has its
obstacles to success. As usual some of the worst of
these are its injudicious “friends.” For instance, there
are the people who are trying their best to “queer” us
in the eyes of civilized Europe. These silly souls, when
Negroes ask that the principle of “Justice in War Time”:
be applied to Negroes as well as whites, reply, in effect
that this should not be; that Negroes should not want
Justice&mdash;in war time&mdash;and that any such demand on their
part is “disloyalty.” On the contrary, it is the fullest
loyalty to the letter and spirit of the President's war-aims.
To say that it isn't is to presume to accuse the President
of having war-aims other than those which he has set
forth in the face of Europe.

Besides, no one can deny that freedom from lynching
and disfranchisement and the ending of discrimination&mdash;by
the Red Cross for instance&mdash;will strengthen the hand
of the administration right now by strengthening its hold
on the hearts of the Negro masses and will make all
Negroes&mdash;soldiers as well as civilians&mdash;more competent
to give effective aid in winning the war.

Let us assume that we consent to being lynched&mdash;“during
the war”&mdash;and submit tamely and with commendable
weakness to being Jim-crowed and disfranchised. Very
well. Will not that be the proof of our spirit and of its
quality? Of course. And what you _call_ that spirit won't
alter its quality, will it? Now, ask all the peoples of all
the world what they call a people who smilingly consent
to their own degradation and destruction. They call such
a people cowards&mdash;because they _are_ cowards. In America
we call such people “niggers.” 

Is anyone unpatriotic enough to pretend that “cowards”
can lick “Huns”? No, this great world-task can be
accomplished only by men&mdash;English men, French men,
Italian men, American men. Our country needs men now
more than it ever did before. And those who multiply
its reserve of men are adding to its strength. That is
why the true patriots who really love America and want
it to win the war are asking America to change its
Negroes from “niggers” into men. Surely this is a patriotic
request; and any one who says that it isn't must be
prepared to maintain that lynching, Jim-crow and disfranchisement
are consistent with patriotism and ought to
be preserved. Reading the President's proclamations in
reverent spirit, we deny both of these monstrous conclusions;
and we believe that we have on our side the
President of America, the world's foremost champion of
democracy who defined it as “the right of all those who
submit to authority to have a VOICE in their
own government”&mdash;whether it be in Germany or in Georgia. And
we believe that the splendid spirit of our common country,
which has buckled on its sword in support of “democracy”
will support us in this reasonable contention. &mdash;July, 1918.

<hr class="tb">
### Why Is the Red Cross?

The Red Cross, or Geneva Association, was the product
of a Swiss infidel. He saw how cruel to man were
those who loved God most&mdash;the Christians&mdash;and, out of
his large humanity and loving kindness, he evolved an
organization which should bring the charity of service
to lessen the lurid horrors of Christian battlefields.

A love that rose above the love of country&mdash;the love
of human kind: this was the proud principle of the Red
Cross. Its nurses and its surgeons, stretcher-bearers and
assistants were supposed to bring relief to those who
were in pain, regardless of whether they were “friends”
or “enemies.” Discrimination was a word which did not
exist for them: and it is not supposed to exist now even
as against the wounded German aviator who has bombed
a Red Cross hospital.

But, alack and alas! The splendid spirit of the Swiss
infidel is seemingly too high for Christian race-prejudice
to reach. Where he would not discriminate even against
enemies, the American branch of his international society
is discriminating against most loyal friends and willing
helpers&mdash;when they are Negroes. Up to date the American
Red Cross Society, which receives government aid
and co-operation to help win the war, cannot cite the
name of a single Negro woman as a nurse. True, it says
that it has “enrolled” some. This we refuse to believe.
But even if that were true, a nurse “enrolled” cannot
save the life of any of our soldiers in France.

The Red Cross says that it wants to win the war.
What war? A white people's war, or America's and
the world's? It this were a white people's war, as some
seem to think, colored troops from Senegal, India, Egypt,
America and the West Indies would have been kept out
of it. But they were not, and we are driven to conclude
that this is a world war. Then why doesn't the American
Red Cross meet it in the spirit of the President&mdash;of
world democracy? The cry goes up for nurses to save
the lives of soldiers; yet here are thousands of Negro
nurses whom the Red Cross won't accept. They must
want to give Europe a “rotten” opinion of American
democracy. For we may be sure that these things are
known in Europe&mdash;even as our lynchings are. And anyone
who would give Europe a “rotten” opinion of America
at this time is no friend of America.

The American Red Cross must be compelled to do
America's work in the spirit in which America has entered
the war. There need be no biting of tongues: it
must be compelled to forego Race Prejudice. If the
N.A.A.C.P. were truly what it pretends instead of a
National Association for the Advancement of Certain
People, it would put its high-class lawyers on the job and
bring the case into the United States courts. It would
charge the American Red Cross with disloyalty to the
war-aims of America. And if it does not (in spite of
the money which it got from the “silent” protest parade
and other moneys and legal talent at its disposal) then
it will merit the name which one of its own members
gave it&mdash;the National Association for the Acceptance of
Color Proscription. Get busy, “friends of the colored
people”! For we are not disposed to regard the camouflage
of those who want nurses but do not want Negro
nurses in any other light than that of Bret Harte's Truthful
James:&mdash;

### A Hint of Our Reward

The wisdom of our contemporary ancestors, having
decided that “We Negroes must make every sacrifice to
help win the war and lay aside our just demands for the
present that we may win a shining place on the pages of
history,” it must be cold comfort to learn that the first
after-the-war schoolbook of American history is out, that
it is written by Reuben Gold Thwaites and Calvin Noyes
Kendall, that it devotes thirty-one pages to the war
and America's part in the war, and that _not one word is
said of the Negro's part therein._

Of course, sensible men should feel no surprise at this,
for they will realize how little the part played by the
Negro in the Civil War is known by the millions of white
school children who read the school histories. Yet, if
there is a spark of manhood left in the bosoms of our
“white men's niggers” who sold us out during the war
they must feel pained and humiliated when the flood of
after-the-war school histories, of which this is the first,
quietly sink the Negro's contributions (as chronicled by
Mr. Emmett Scott and others) into the back waters of
forgetfulness.

The times change, but we don't change with them.

<hr class="tb">
### The Negro at the Peace Congress

Now that they have helped to win the war against
Germany, the Negro people in these United States feel
the absurdity of the situation in which they find themselves.
They have given lavishly of their blood and treasure.
They have sent their young men overseas as soldiers,
and were willing to send their young women overseas
as nurses; but the innate race-prejudice of the
American Red Cross prevented them. They have contributed
millions of dollars to the funds of this same Red
Cross and scores of millions to the four Liberty Loans;
and they have done all this to help make the world “safe
for democracy” even while in sixteen States of the south
in which nine-tenths of them reside, they have no voice in
their own government. Naturally they expect that something
will have to be done to remove their civil and other
disabilities. This expectation of theirs is a just and reasonable
one. But&mdash; &mdash;

Now that the world is getting ready for the Peace Congress
which is expected to settle _the questions about which
the war was fought_ our Negroes want to know if the
Peace Congress will settle such questions as those of
lynching, disfranchisement and segregation. IT WILL
NOT! And why? Simply because the war was not
fought over these questions. Even a fool can see that.
Lynching, disfranchisement and Jim-crowing in America
are questions of American domestic policy and can be
regulated only by American law-making and administrative
bodies. Even a fool should be able to see this. And,
since it was only by the military aid of the United States
that the Allies were able to win the war, why should our
people be stupid enough to think that the allied nations
will aim a slap at the face of the United States (even if
such things were customary) by attempting to interfere
in her domestic arrangements and institutions?

We learn that various bodies of Negroes, who do not
seem to understand the modern system of political government
under which they live, are seeking to get money
from the unsuspecting masses of our people “for the
purpose of sending delegates to the Peace Congress.” The
project is sublimely silly. In the first place, the Peace
Congress is not open to anybody who chooses to be sent.
A peep into any handbook of modern history would show
that Peace Congresses are made up only of delegates
chosen by the heads of the governments of the countries
which have been at war, and never by civic, propaganda,
or other bodies within those nations. Only the President
of the United States has power to designate the American
delegates to the Peace Congress.

Of course, if any body of people wish to send a visitor
to Versailles or Paris _at their expense_, the government of
the United States has nothing to do with that and would
not prevent it. But such visitor, lacking credentials from
the President, could not get within a block of the Peace
Congress. They can (if they read French) get from the
papers published in the city where the Congress meets so
much of the proceedings as the Congress may choose to
give to the press. But that is all; and for that it is not
necessary to go to France. Just send to France for copies
of _Le Temps_ or _Le Matin_ and prevent a useless waste of
the money of poor people who can ill afford it in any case.

“But,” we are told, “such person or persons can make
propaganda (in France) which will force the Peace Congress
to consider American lynching, disfranchisement
and segregation,” Passing over the argument that such
person or persons would have to be able to write French
fluently, we wish to point out that the public sentiment of
even one French city takes more than a month to work up;
that the sentiment of one French city can have but slight
weight with the Congress, and that, if it could rise to the
height of embarrassing them, the French authorities
would sternly put it down and banish the troublesome
persons. Karl Marx, Prince Kropotkin, Malatesta and
Lenine are cases in point as showing what France has
done under less provoking circumstances.

Let us not try to play the part of silly fools. Lynching,
disfranchisement and segregation are evils HERE;
and the place in which we must fight them is HERE. If
foolish would-be leaders have no plan to lay before our
people for the fighting HERE, in God’s name, let them
say so, and stand out of the way! Let us gird up our
loins for the stern tasks which lie before us HERE and
address ourselves to them with courage and intelligence.

### Africa and the Peace

“This war, disguise it how we may, is really being
fought over African questions.” So said Sir Harry Johnston,
one of the foremost authorities on Africa, in the
London Sphere in June, 1917. We wonder if the Negroes
of the Western world quite realize what this means.
Wars are not fought for ideals but for lands whose populations
can be put to work, for resources that can be
minted into millions, for trade that can be made to enrich
the privileged few. When King Leopold of Belgium
and Thomas Fortune Ryan of New York joined hands
to exploit the wealth of the Congo they did it with oiled
phrases on their lips. They called that land of horrors
and of shame “The Congo FREE State!”

And, so, when Nations go to war, they never openly
declare what they WANT. They must camouflage their
sordid greed behind some sounding phrase like “freedom
of the seas,” “self-determination,” “liberty” or “democracy.” 
But only the ignorant millions ever think that
those are the real objects of their bloody rivalries. When
the war is over, the mask is dropped, and then they seek
“how best to scramble at the shearers’ feast.” It is then
that they disclose their real war aims.

One of the most striking cases in point is the present
peace congress. Already President Wilson has had to go
to look after democracy himself. Already responsible
heads of the Allied governments are making it known
that “freedom of the seas” means a benevolent naval
despotism maintained by them, and that “democracy”
means simply the transfer of Germany’s African lands
to England and the others. Africa at the peace table constitutes
the real stakes which the winners will rake in.
We may read in headlines the startling item “Negroes
Ask For German Colonies,” but Negroes of sense should
not be deluded. They will not get them because they
have no battleships, no guns, no force, military or financial.
They are not a Power.

Despite the pious piffle of nice old gentlemen like Professor
Kelly Miller, the King-word of modern nations is
POWER. It is only Sunday school “kids” and people of
child-races who take seriously such fables as that in the
“Band of Hope Review” when we were children that
“the secret of England’s greatness is the Bible.” The
secret of England’s greatness (as well as of any other
great nation’s) is not bibles but bayonets&mdash;bayonets,
business and brains. As long as the white nations have
a preponderance of these, so long will they rule. Ask
Japan: she knows. And as long as the lands of Africa
can yield billions of business, so long will white brains
use bayonets to keep them&mdash;as the British government
did last year in Nigeria.

_Africa is turning over in her sleep, and this agitation
now going on among American Negroes for the liberation
of Africa is a healthy sign of her restlessness. But it is
no more than that._ Africa’s hands are tied, and, so tied,
she will be thrown upon the peace table. Let us study
how to unloose her bonds later. Instead of futile expectations
from the doubtful generosity of white land-grabbers,
let us American Negroes go to Africa, live among
the natives and LEARN WHAT THEY HAVE TO
TEACH US (for they have much to teach us). Let us
go there&mdash;not in the coastlands,&mdash;but in the interior, in
Nigeria and Nyassaland; let us study engineering and
physics, chemistry and commerce, agriculture and industry;
let us learn more of nitrates, of copper, rubber and
electricity; so will we know why Belgium, France, England
and Germany want to be in Africa. Let us begin
by studying the scientific works of the African explorers
and stop reading and believing the silly slush which
ignorant missionaries put into our heads about the alleged
degradation of our people in Africa. Let us learn to
know Africa and Africans so well that every educated
Negro will be able at a glance to put his hand on the
map of Africa and tell where to find the Jolofs, Ekois,
Mandingoes, Yorubas, Bechuanas or Basutos and can tell
something of their marriage customs, their property laws,
their agriculture and systems of worship. For, not until
we can do this will it be seemly for us to pretend to be
anxious about their political welfare.

Indeed, it would be well now for us to establish friendly
relations and correspondence with our brothers at home.
For we don’t know enough about them to be able to do
them any good at THIS peace congress (even if we were
graciously granted seats there); but fifty years from
now&mdash;WHO KNOWS?

<hr class="tb">
### “They Shall Not Pass!”

When heroic France was holding the Kaiser’s legions
at bay her inflexible resolution found expression in the
phrase, “Ils ne passeront pas!"&mdash;they shall not pass! The
white statesmen who run our government in Washington
seem to have adopted the poilu’s watchword in a less
worthy cause. The seventy-odd Negro “delegates” to the
Peace Congress who have got themselves “elected” at
mass-meetings and concerts for the purpose of going
to France are not going&mdash;unless they can walk, swim, or
fly. For the government will not issue passports for
them.

Of course, the government is not telling them so in
plain English. That wouldn’t be like our government. It
merely makes them wait while their money melts away.
Day after day and week after week, they wearily wend
their way to the official Circumlocution Office where they
receive a reply considered sufficient for their child-minds:
“Not yet.”

It is many weeks since Madam Walker, Mr. Trotter,
Judge Harrison and other lesser lights were elected, but
“They shall not pass!” says the government with the
backing of Emmett Scott. THE VOICE holds no brief
for these people: in fact it has taken the trouble to tell
them more than once how silly their project was. But it
is not out of order to inquire why the government will
not let them go, and to find an answer to that question.

The government will not let them go to France, because
the government’s conscience is not clear. And the government
ordered that ludicrous lackey, Mr. R. R. Moton,
to go&mdash;for the same reason. In fact, the creation of sinecures
for Mr. Scott and the other barnacles is due largely
to an uneasy conscience. How would it look to have
Negroes telling all Europe that the land which is to make
the world “safe for democracy” is rotten with race-prejudice;
Jim-crows Negro officers on ships coming over
from France and on trains run under government control;
condones lynching by silent acquiescence and refuses
to let its Negro heroes vote as citizens in that part of
the country in which nine-tenths of them live. This
wouldn’t do at all.

Therefore: They shall not pass! And if, finally, the
government, nettled by such criticisms, should lift the
ban when the Peace Congress is practically over, the
Negroes of America may be sure that those permitted to
go will be carefully hand-picked.

But what is the matter with America as a land for
pioneer work in planting democracy? Are these Negro
_emigrés_ afraid to face the white men here in the Republican
Party or any other and raise Hades until the Constitution
is enforced? Is cowardice the real reason for
their running to France to uncork their mouths? It looks
very much like it. Ladies and gentlemen: don’t run.
The fight is here, and here you will be compelled to face
it, or report to us the reason why.

<hr class="tb">
### A Cure for the Ku-Klux

It was in the city of Pulaski in Giles County, Tennessee,
that the original Ku-Klux Klan was organized
in the latter part of 1865. The war had hardly been
declared officially at an end when the cowardly “crackers”
who couldn’t lick the Yankees began organizing to take
it out of the Negroes. They passed laws declaring that
any black man who couldn’t show three hundred dollars
should be declared a vagrant; that every vagrant should
be put to work in the chain-gang on the public works of
their cities; that three Negroes should not gather together
unless a white man was with them, and other such
methods were used as were found necessary to maintain
“white supremacy.” When the national Congress met in
December, 1865, it looked upon these light diversions
with an unfriendly eye and, noting that nothing short of
the re-enslavement of the Negroes would satisfy the
“crackers,” it kept them out of Congress until they
would agree to do better. Finding that they were stiff-necked,
Congress passed the 14th and 15th amendments
and put the “cracker” states under military rule until they
accepted the amendments. The result was that the Negro
got the ballot as a protection from “the people who know
him best.” 

In the meanwhile, the Ku-Klux after rampaging around
under the leadership of that traitor, General Nathaniel B.
Forrest, was put down-for good, as it was thought.
Today, after the Negro has been stripped of the ballot’s
protection by the connivance of white Republicans in
Washington and white Democrats at the South, the
Ku-Klux dares to raise its ugly head in its ancestral
state of Tennessee. This time they want to increase that
fine brand of democracy which every coward editor knows
that Negroes were getting when they were bidding them
to be patriotic. The Ku-Klux means to shoot them into
submission and torture them into terror before they get
to showing their wounds and asking for the ballot as a
recompense.

In this crisis what have the Negro “leaders” got to say
on their people’s behalf? Where is Emmett Scott?
Where are Mr. Moton and Dr. Du Bois? What will the
N.A.A.C.P. do besides writing frantic letters? We
fear that they can never rise above the level of appeals.
But suppose the common Negro in Tennessee decides to
take a hand in the game? Suppose he lets it be known
that for the life of every Negro soldier or civilian, two
“crackers” will die? Suppose he lets them know that it
will be as costly to kill Negroes as it would be to kill real
people? Then indeed the Ku-Klux would be met upon its
own ground. And why not?

All our laws, even in Tennessee, declare that lynching
and white-capping are crimes against the person. All our
laws declare that people singly or in groups have the right
to kill in defense of their lives. And if the Ku-Klux
prevents the officers of the law from enforcing that law,
then it is up to Negroes to help the officers by enforcing
the law on their own account. Why shouldn’t they do
it? Lead and steel, fire and poison are just as potent
against “crackers” as they were against Germans, and
democracy is as well worth fighting for in Tennessee as
ever it was on the plains of France. Not until the
Negroes of the south recognize this truth will anybody
else recognize it for them.
