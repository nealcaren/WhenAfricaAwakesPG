## CHAPTER VI.<BR>THE NEW RACE CONSCIOUSNESS.

### The Negro’s Own Radicalism

Twenty years ago all Negroes known to the white
publicists of America could be classed as conservatives
on all the great questions on which thinkers differ. In
matters of industry, commerce, politics, religion, they
could be trusted to take the backward view. Only on the
question of the Negro’s “rights” could a small handful
be found bold enough to be tagged as “radicals”&mdash;and
they were howled down by both the white and colored
adherents of the conservative point of view. Today
Negroes differ on all those great questions on which white
thinkers differ, and there are Negro radicals of every
imaginary stripe&mdash;agnostics, atheists, I.W.W.’s Socialists, 
Single Taxers, and even Bolshevists.

In the good old days white people derived their knowledge 
of what Negroes were doing from those Negroes
who were nearest to them, generally their own selected
exponents of Negro activity or of their white point of
view. A classic illustration of this kind of knowledge was
afforded by the Republican Party; but the Episcopal
Church, the Urban League, or the U. S. Government
would serve as well. Today the white world is vaguely,
but disquietingly, aware that Negroes are awake, different
and perplexingly uncertain. Yet the white world by
which they are surrounded retains its traditional method
of interpreting the mass by the Negro nearest to themselves 
in affiliation or contact. The Socialist party thinks
that the “unrest” now apparent in the Negro masses is
due to the propaganda which its adherents support, and
believes that it will function largely along the lines of
socialist political thought. The great dailies, concerned
mainly with their chosen task of being the mental bellwethers 
of the mob, scream “Bolshevist propaganda” and
flatter themselves that they have found the true cause;
while the government’s unreliable agents envisage it as
“disloyalty.” The truth, as usual, is to be found in the
depths; but there they are all prevented from going by
mental laziness and that traditional off-handed, easy contempt 
with which white men in America, from scholars
like Lester Ward to scavengers like Stevenson, deign to
consider the colored population of twelve millions.

In the first place, the cause of “radicalism” among
American Negroes is international. But it is necessary to
draw clear distinctions at the outset. The function of
the Christian church is international. So is art, war, the
family, rum and the exploitation of labor. But none of
these is entitled to extend the mantle of its own peculiar
“internationalism” to cover the present case of the Negro
discontent&mdash;although this has been attempted. The international 
Fact to which Negroes in America are now reacting 
is not the exploitation of laborers by capitalists;
but the social, political and economic subjection of colored
peoples by white. It is not the Class Line, but the Color
Line, which is the incorrect but accepted expression for
the Dead Line of racial inferiority. This fact is a fact of
Negro consciousness as well as a fact of externals. The
international Color Line is the practice and theory of that
doctrine which holds that the best stocks of Africa, China,
Egypt and the West Indies are inferior to the worst stocks
of Belgium, England and Italy, and must hold their lives,
lands and liberties upon such terms and conditions as the
white races may choose to grant them.

On the part of the whites, the motive was originally
economic; but it is no longer purely so. All the available
facts go to prove that, whether in the United States or in
Africa or China, the economic subjection is without exception 
keener and more brutal when the exploited are
black, brown and yellow, than when they are white. And
the fact that black, brown and yellow also exploit each
other brutally whenever Capitalism has created the
economic classes of plutocrat and proletarian should suffice 
to put purely economic subjection out of court as the
prime cause of racial unrest. For the similarity of suffering 
has produced in all lands where whites rule colored
races a certain similarity of sentiment, viz.: a racial revulsion 
of racial feeling. The peoples of those lands begin
to feel and realize that they are so subjected because they
are members of races condemned as “inferior” by their
Caucasian overlords. The fact presented to their minds
is one of race, and in terms of race do they react to it.
Put the case to any Negro by way of test and the answer
will make this clear.

The great World War, by virtue of its great advertising
campaign for democracy and the promises which were
held out to all subject peoples, fertilized the Race Consciousness 
of the Negro people into the stage of conflict
with the dominant white idea of the Color Line. They
took democracy at its face value&mdash;which is&mdash;equality. So
did the Hindus, Egyptians and West Indians. This is
what the hypocritical advertisers of democracy had not
bargained for. The American Negroes, like the other
darker peoples, are presenting their checques and trying
to “cash in,” and delays in that process, however unavoidable 
to the paying tellers, are bound to beget a plentiful
lack of belief in either their intention or their ability to
pay. Hence the run on Democracy’s bank&mdash;“the Negro
unrest” of the newspaper paragraphers.

Undoubtedly some of these newly-awakened Negroes
will take to Socialism and Bolshevism. But here again
the reason is racial. Since they suffer racially from the
world as at present organized by the white race, some of
their ablest hold that it is “good play” to encourage and
give aid to every subversive movement within that white
world which makes for its destruction “as it is.” For by
its subversion they have much to gain and nothing to lose.
Yet they build on their own foundations. Parallel with
the dogma of Class-Consciousness they run the dogma of
Race-Consciousness. And they dig deeper. For the roots
of Class-Consciousness inhere in a temporary economic
order; whereas the roots of Race-Consciousness must of
necessity survive any and all changes in the economic
order. Accepting biology, as a fact, their view is the
more fundamental. At any rate, it is that view with
which the white world will have to deal. &mdash;The *New
Negro*, October, 1919.

### Race First Versus Class First

“In the old days white people derived their knowledge
of what Negroes were doing from those Negroes who
were nearest to them, largely their own selected exponents 
of Negro activity or of their white point of
view. * * * Today the white world is vaguely, but
disquietingly, aware that Negroes are awake; different.
but perplexingly uncertain. Yet the white world by which
they are surrounded retains its traditional method of interpreting 
the mass by the Negro nearest to themselves in
affiliation or contact. The Socialist party still persists
in thinking that the unrest now apparent in the Negro
masses is due to the propaganda which its paid adherents
support, and believes that the unrest will function largely
along the lines of Socialist political thought.”
It is necessary to insist on this point today when the
Socialist party of America has secretly subsidized both a
magazine and a newspaper to attempt to cut into the
splendid solidarity which Negroes are achieving in response 
to the call of racial necessity. It is necessary to
point out that “radical” young Negroes may betray the interests 
of the race into alien hands just as surely as “the
old crowd.” For, after all, the essence of both betrayals
consists in making the racial requirements play second
fiddle to the requirements dictated as best for it by other
groups with other interests to serve. The fact that one
group of alien interests is described as “radical” and the
other as “reactionary” is of very slight value to us.

In the days when the Socialist Party of America was
respectable, although it never drew lines of racial separation 
in the North, it permitted those lines to be drawn in
the South. It had no word of official condemnation for
the Socialists of Tennessee who prevented Theresa Malkiel 
in 1912 from lecturing to Negroes on Socialism either
in the same hall with them or in meetings of their own.
It was the national office of the party which in that same
presidential year refused to route Eugene V. Debs in the
South because that Grand Old Man let it be known that
he would not remain silent on the race question while in
the South. They wanted the votes of the white South
then, and were willing to betray by silence the principles
of inter-racial solidarity which they espoused on paper.

Now, when their party has shrunk considerably in
popular support and sentiment, they are willing to take
up our cause. Well, we thank honest white people everywhere 
who take up our cause, but we wish them to know
that we have already taken it up ourselves. While they
were refusing to diagnose our case we diagnosed it ourselves, 
and, now that we have prescribed the remedy&mdash;Race 
Solidarity&mdash;they come to us with their prescription&mdash;Class Solidarity. It is too late, gentlemen! This racial
alignment is all our own product, and we have no desire
to turn it over to you at this late day, when we are beginning
 to reap its benefits. And if you are simple enough
to believe that those among us who serve your interests
ahead of ours have any monopoly of intellect or information 
along the lines of modern learning, then you are the
greater gulls indeed.

We can respect the Socialists of Scandinavia, France,
Germany or England on their record. But your record so
far does not entitle you to the respect of those of us who
can see all around a subject. We say Race First, because
you have all along insisted on Race First and class after
when you didn’t need our help. We reproduce below a
brief portion of your record in those piping times of
peace, and ask you to explain it. If you are unable to do
so, set your lackeys to work; they may be able to do it in
terms of their own “radical scientific” surface slush. The
following is taken from the majority report of one of
your national committees during one of your recent national 
conventions. It was signed by Ernest Untermann
and J. Stitt Wilson, representing the West, and Joshua
Wanhope, editor of the *Call*, and Robert Hunter, representing 
the East, and it was adopted as a portion of the
party program. We learn from it that&mdash;

> “Race feeling is not so much a result of social as of
biological evolution. It does not change essentially with
changes of economic systems. It is deeper than any class
feeling and will outlast the capitalist system. It persists even
after race prejudice has been outgrown. It exists not because
the capitalists nurse it for economic reasons, but the capitalists 
rather have an opportunity to nurse it for economic
reasons because it exists as a product of biology. It is
bound to play a role in the economics of the future society.
If it should not assert itself in open warfare under a Socialist 
form of society, it will nevertheless lead to a rivalry of
races for expansion over the globe as a result of the play of
natural and sexual selection. We may temper this race
feeling by education, but we can never hope to extinguish it
altogether. Class-consciousness must be learned, but race
consciousness is inborn and cannot be wholly unlearned. A
few individuals may indulge in the luxury of ignoring race
and posing as utterly raceless humanitarians, but whole
races never.
> Where races struggle for the means of life, racial animosities 
cannot be avoided. Where working people struggle for
jobs, self-preservation enforces its decrees. Economic and
political considerations lead to racial fights and to legislation
restricting the invasion of the white man’s domain by other
races.”

It is well that the New Negro should know this, since it
justifies him in giving you a taste of your own medicine.
The writer of these lines is also a Socialist; but he refuses 
in this crisis of the world’s history to put either
Socialism or your party above the call of his race. And
he does this on the very grounds which you yourselves
have given in the document quoted above. Also because
he is not a fool. &mdash;March 27th, 1920.

### An Open Letter to the Socialist Party of New York City

Gentlemen: During 1917 the white leaders of the
Republican party were warned that the Negroes of this
city were in a mood unfavorable to the success of their
party at the polls and that this mood was likely to last
until they changed their party’s attitude toward the Negro
masses. They scouted this warning because the Negroes
whom they had selected to interpret Negro sentiment for
them still confidently assured them that there had been
no change of sentiment on the part of the Negro people,
and white politicians did not think it necessary to come
and find out for themselves. Consequently they were lied
to by those whose bread and butter depended on such
lying. Then came the mayoralty campaign, and, when it
was too late they discovered their mistake. At a memorable 
meeting at Palace Casino John Purroy Mitchell, the
candidate of the Republican party, and Theodore Roosevelt, 
its idol, were almost hissed off the stage, while the
Mitchell outdoor speakers found it impossible to speak on
the street corners of Harlem. The party went down to
defeat and Judge Hylan was elected.

All this is recent history, and it is called to your attention 
at this time only because you are in danger of making
a similar costly mistake. You, too, have selected Negro
spokesmen on whose word you choose to rely for information 
as to the tone and temper of Negro political
sentiment. You have chosen to adopt the same faulty
method of the white Republican politicians, and you do
not care to go behind the word of your selected exponents
of Negro thought and feeling. Yet the pitiful vote which
you polled in the last election might have warned you that
something had gone wrong in your arrangements. What
that something is we shall now proceed to show you&mdash;if
you are still able to see.

During the recent world war the Negro in America was
taught that while white people spoke of patriotism, religion, 
democracy and other sounding themes, they remained 
loyal to one concept above all others, and that was
the concept of race. Even in the throes of war, and on
the battlefields of France it was “race first” with them.
Out of this realization was born the new Negro ideal
of “race first” for us. And today, whether Negroes be
Catholics or Protestants, capitalists or wage workers, Republicans 
or Democrats, native or foreign-born, they begin
life anew on this basis. Alike in their business alignments,
their demands on the government and political parties,
and in their courageous response to race rioters, they are
responding to this sentiment which has been bred by the
attitude of white men here and everywhere else where
white rules black. To be sure, neither Burleson nor
Palmer have told you or the rest of the white world this.
The Angle-Saxon white man is a notorious hypocrite; and
they have preferred to prate of Bolshevism&mdash;your
“radicalism”&mdash;rather than tell the truth of racialism, our
“radicalism,” because this was an easier explanation,
more in keeping with official stupidity. But we had supposed 
that you were intelligent enough to find this out.
Evidently, you were not.

Your official Negro exponents, on behalf of their bread
and butter, have seized on this widely-published official
explanation to make you believe that the changed attitude 
of the Negro masses was due to the propaganda
which you were paying them (at their published request)
to preach. But this is a lie. Don’t take our word for it.
Do some reading on your own account. Get a hundred
different Negro newspapers and magazines, outside of
those which you have subsidized, and study their editorial
and other pronouncements, and you will see that this is so.

But let us come nearer home. The propaganda of
Socialism has been preached in times past in Harlem by
different people without awakening hostility of any sort.
Today it elicits a hostility which is outspoken. Send up
and see; then ask yourselves the reason. You will find a
Negro Harlem reborn, with business enterprises and cultural 
arrangements. And these things have been established 
without any help from you or those who eat your
bread. Even the work of Socialist propaganda was neglected 
by you between 1912 and 1917. Consult your own
memories and the columns of the Call.


All these things are the recent products of the principle 
of “race first.” And among them the biggest is the
Universal Negro Improvement Association, with its associate 
bodies, the Black Star Line and the Negro Factories 
Corporation. No movement among American
Negroes since slavery was abolished has ever attained the
gigantic proportions of this. The love and loyalty of
millions go out to it as well as the cold cash of tens of
thousands. Yet your Negro hirelings have seen fit to
use the organs which you have given them to spread
Socialist propaganda for the purpose of attacking all
these things, and the Black Star Line in particular. Do
you wonder now that they meet with such outspoken opposition 
that they have been driven to seek an underhanded 
alliance with the police (as your Negro Socialist
organ avows in its latest issue)? Isn’t that a glorious
alliance for purposes of Negro propaganda? When such
things can happen you may depend upon it that someone 
has been fooling you.

And, just as the white Republicans did, you have
assumed that those whom chance or change brought
your way have, somehow, achieved a monopoly
of the intellect and virtue of the Negro race.
Do you think that this is sound sense on your
part? Of course, it was natural that they should
tell you so. But was it natural for you to be so simple as
to believe it? On March 27 this newspaper in an editorial
quoted a passage from one of your official documents
showing that the white men of your party officially put
“race first” rather than “class first,” which latter phrase
is your henchmen’s sole contribution to “sociology”&mdash;for
us. The quoted passage cuts the very heart out of their
case. And yet, those whom you have selected to represent 
you are so green and sappy in their Socialism that,
although six weeks have elapsed since this was hurled at
their thick heads, not one of them has yet been able to
trace to its source, this quotation from one of your own
official documents. Think of it! And in the meantime
you yourselves are such “easy marks” that you believe
them, on their own assertion, to be the ablest among the
Negroes of America. It is not easy to decide which of the
two groups is the bigger joke&mdash;you or they.

You have constantly insisted that “there is no race
problem, only an economic problem,” but you will soon
be in a fair way to find out otherwise. Some day you will,
perhaps, have learned enough to cease being “suckers”
for perpetual candidates who dickered with the Democrats 
up to within a month of “flopping” to your party
only because they “couldn’t make it” elsewhere; some day,
perhaps, you will know enough to put Socialism’s cause
in the hands of those who will refrain from using your
party’s organ for purposes of personal pique, spite and 
venom. When that day dawns Socialism will have a
chance to be heard by Negroes on its merits. And even
now, if you should send anyone up here (black or white)
to put the cause of Karl Marx, freed from admixture of
rancor and hatred of the Negro’s own defensive racial
propaganda, you may find that it will have as good a
chance of gaining adherents as any other political creed.
But until you change your tactics or make your exponents 
change theirs your case among us will be hopeless
indeed. &mdash;May, 1920.

### “Patronize Your Own.”

The doctrine of “Race First,” although utilized largely
by the Negro business men of Harlem, has never received
any large general support from them. If we remember
rightly, it was the direct product of the out-door and indoor 
lecturers who flourished in Harlem between 1914
and 1916. Not all who were radical shared this sentiment. 
For instance, we remember the debate between
Mr. Hubert Harrison, then president of the Liberty
League, and Mr. Chandler Owen, at Palace Casino in
December, 1918, in which the “radical” Owen fiercely
maintained “that the doctrine of race first was an indefensible 
doctrine”; Mr. Harrison maintaining that it
was the source of salvation for the race. Both these
gentlemen have run true to form ever since.

But to return to our thesis. The secondary principle
of “patronize your own,” flowing as it does from the main
doctrine of “race first,” is subject to the risk of being exploited 
dishonestly&mdash;particularly by business men. And
business men in Harlem have shown themselves capable
of doing this all the time. They seem to forget that “do
unto others as you would have them do unto you” is a
part of the honest application of this doctrine. Many of
these men seem to want other black people to pay them
for being black. They seem to think that a dirty place
and imperfect service and 3 cents more a pound should
be rewarded with racial patronage regardless of these
demerits.

On the other hand, there have grown up in Harlem
Negro businesses, groceries, ice cream parlors, etc., in
which the application of prices, courtesy and selling
efficiency are maintained. This is the New Negro business 
man, and we say “more power to him.” If this 
method of applying the principle should continue to increase 
in popularity we are sure to have in Harlem and
elsewhere a full and flowing tide of Negro business enterprises 
gladly and loyally supported by the mass of Negro
purchasers to their mutual benefit.

The Negro business man who is unintelligently selfish,
makes a hash of racial welfare in the attempt to achieve
individual success. A case in point is that of the brown-skinned 
dolls. Twenty years ago the Negro child’s only
choice was between a white Caucasian doll and the “nigger
doll.” On the lower levels the one was as cheap as the
other. Then, a step at a time came the picturesque poupee,
variously described as the “Negro doll,” the “colored
doll” and the “brown-skinned doll.” This was sold by
white stores at an almost prohibitive price. It was made
three times as easy for the Negro child to idolize a white
doll as to idolize one with the features of its own race.
When the principle of “Race First” began to be proclaimed
from scores of platforms and pulpits, certain Negro
business men saw a chance to benefit the race and, incidently 
to reap a wonderful harvest of profits, by appealing 
to a principle for whose support and maintenance, here
and elsewhere, they had never paid a cent. “Factories”
for the production of brown-skinned dolls began to spring
up&mdash;most of the factoring consisting of receiving these
dolls from white factories and either stuffing them with
saw dust, excelsior or other filling, or merely changing
them from one wrapper to another. Bear in mind that
the proclaimed object was to make it easier for the Negro
mother to teach race patriotism to her Negro child. Yet
it was soon notorious that these leeches were charging
$3, $4 and $5 for Negro dolls which could sell at prices
ranging from 75 cents to $1.25, and yet leave a handsome
margin of profit.

The result is that today even in Negro Harlem nine out
of ten Negro children are forced to play with white dolls,
because rapacious scoundrels have been capitalizing the
principle of “patronize your own” in a one-sided way. By
lowering their prices to a reasonable level, they could extend 
their business tremendously. Failing to do this, they
are playing into the hands of the vendors of white dolls
and making it much easier for the Negro mother to select
a white doll for her child; limiting at once their own
market and restricting the development of a larger racial
ideal.

### The Women of Our Race

America owes much to the foreigner and the Negro in
America owes even more. For it was the white foreigner 
who first proclaimed that the only music which
America had produced that was worthy of the name was
Negro music. It naturally took some time for this truth
to sink in, and, in the meantime, the younger element of
Negroes, in their weird worship of everything that was
white, neglected and despised their own race-music. More
than one college class had walked out, highly insulted,
when their white teachers had asked them to sing “Swing
Low Sweet Chariot” and “My Lord, What a Morning.”

It is to be hoped that they now know better.
But the real subject of this editorial is not Negro music,
but Negro women. If any foreigner should come here
from Europe, Asia or Africa and be privileged to pass in
review the various kinds of women who live in our
America he would pick out as the superior of them all&mdash;the 
Negro woman. It seems a great pity that it should
be left to the foreigner to “discover” the Negro-American
woman. For her own mankind have been seeing her for
centuries. And yet, outside of the vague rhetoric of the
brethren in church and lodge when they want her to turn
their functions into financial successes, and outside of
Paul Dunbar and perhaps two other poets, no proper
amount of esthetic appreciation of her has been forthcoming 
from their side.

Consider the facts of the case. The white women of
America are charming to look at-in the upper social
classes. But even the Negro laundress, cook or elevator-girl far surpasses her mistress in the matter of feminine
charms. No white woman has a color as beautiful as the
dark browns, light-browns, peach-browns, or gold and
bronze of the Negro girl. These are some of the things
which make a walk through any Negro section of New
York or Washington such a feast of delight.

Then, there is the matter of form. The bodies and
limbs of our Negro women are, on the whole, better built
and better shaped than those of any other women on earth&mdash;except perhaps, the Egyptian women’s. And their gait
and movement would require an artist to properly
describe. The grace of their carriage is inimitable.

But their most striking characteristic is a feature which
even the crude mind of mere man can appreciate.
It is, to quote “Gunga Din,” “the way in which they carry
their clothes.” They dress well&mdash;not merely in the sense
that their clothing is costly and good to look at; but in
that higher sense in which the Parisian woman is the best-dressed 
woman in Europe. From shoes and stockings to
shirtwaists and hats, they choose their clothes with fine
taste and show them off to the best advantage when they
put them on. That is why a man may walk down the
avenue with a Negro cook or factory girl without anyone’s 
being able to guess that she has to work for a living.
And, finally, in the matter of that indefinable something 
which, for want of a better word, we call simply
“charm”&mdash;the Negro women are far ahead of all others
in America. They have more native grace, more winsomeness,
greater beauty and more fire and passion.
These facts have already begun to attract attention, here
and elsewhere, and, eventually, the Negro woman will
come into her own.

What say you, brothers! Shall we not love her while
she is among us? Shall we not bend the knee in worship
and thank high heaven for the great good fortune which
has given us such sisters and sweethearts, mothers and
wives?

### To the Young Men of My Race

The Negro is already at work on the problems of reconstruction. 
He finds himself in the midst of a world
which is changing to its very foundations. Yet millions
of Negroes haven’t now&mdash;and have never had&mdash;the slightest 
knowledge or idea of what those foundations are. How
can they render effective aid to the world without understanding 
something of how the world, or society, is arranged, 
how it runs, and how it is run?

No one, friendly or unfriendly, can deny that the
Negroes of America do wish to help in constructing this
world of men and things which will emerge from the
Great War. They want to help, because they realize that
their standing and welfare and happiness in that world
will very largely depend upon what kind of world it is.
They have not been happy, so far, in America&mdash;nor, so
far as the white man’s rule is concerned,&mdash;anywhere else
under it. And they want to be happy, if that be possible.
For which reason they want to help in the re-shaping of
the world-to-be.

They feel the burdens put on them by the White Lords
of subjection and repression, of 39 cents worth of education 
a year in Alabama, of the deep race hatred of the
Christian Church, the Y.M.C.A. and the Associated
Press; of lynching in the land of “liberty,” disfranchisement 
in “democratic” America and segregation on the
Federal trains and in the Federal departments. They feel
that the world should be set free from this machinery of
mischief-for their sakes as well as that of the world.

Such is the state of mind of the Negro masses here.
And now what does this attitude of the Negro masses require? 
GUIDANCE! Guidance, shaping and direction.
Here is strength, here is power, here is a task to call
forth the sublimest heroism on the part of those who
should lead them. And what do we find? No guidance,
no shaping of the course for these millions. The blind
may not safely lead the blind in these critical times&mdash;and
blind men are practically all that we have as leaders.

The old men whose minds are always retrospecting and
reminiscing to the past, who were “trained” to read a few
dry and dead books which they still fondly believe are
hard to get&mdash;these do not know anything of the modern
world, its power of change and travel, and the mighty
range of its ideas. Its labor problems and their relation
to wars and alliances and diplomacy are not even suspected
by these quaint fossils. They think that they are “leading”
Negro thought, but they could serve us better if they
were cradelled in cotton-wool, wrapped in faded roses,
and laid aside in lavender as mementoes of a dead past.

The young men must gird up their loins for the task
of leadership and leadership has its stern and necessary
duties. The first of these is TRAINING. Not in
a night did the call come to Christ, not in a day was He
made fit to make the great sacrifice. It took thirty years
of preparation to fit him for the work of three. Even
so, on you, young men of Negro America, descends the
duty of the great preparation. Get education. Get it not
only in school and in college, but in books and newspapers,
in market-places, institutions, and movements. Prepare
by knowing; and never think you know until you have
listened to ten others who know differently&mdash;and have
survived the shock.

The young man’s second duty is IRREVERENCE.
Reverence is in one sense, respect for what is antiquated
because it is antiquated. This race has lived in a rut
too long to reverence the rut. Oldsters love ruts because
they help them to “rub along,” they are easy to understand; 
they require the minimum of exertion and brains,
and they give the maximum of ease. Young man! If
you wish to be spiritually alert and alive; to get the very
best out of yourself&mdash;shun a rut as you would shun the
plague! Never bow the knee to Baal because Baal is in
power; never respect wrong and injustice because they are
enshrined in “the sacred institutions of our glorious land”;
never have patience with either Cowardice or Stupidity
because they happen to wear venerable whiskers. Read,
reason, and think on all sides of all subjects. Don’t compare 
yourself with the runner behind you on the road;
always compare yourself with the one ahead; so only will
you go faster and farther. And set it before you, as a
sacred duty always to surpass the teachers that taught you&mdash;and 
this is the essence of irreverence.

The last great duty is COURAGE. Dear man of my
people, if all else should fail you, never let *that* fail.
Much as you need preparation and prevision you are more
in need of Courage. This has been, and is yet, A DOWNTRODDEN 
RACE. Do you
know what a down-trodden race needs most? If you are not sure, take
down your Bible and read the whole story of Gideon
and his band. You will then understand that, as Dunbar,
says:

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse leadingquote">“Minorities since time began</div>
<div class="verse">Have shown the better side of man;</div> 
<div class="verse">And often, in the lists of time,</div>
<div class="verse">One Man has made a cause sublime.”</div>
</div>
</div>

You will learn the full force of what another American 
meant when he told the young men of his age:
