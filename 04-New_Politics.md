## CHAPTER IV.<BR>THE NEW POLITICS.

### The New Politics for the New Negro

The world of the future will look upon the world of
today as an essentially new turning point in the path of
human progress. All over the world the spirit of democratic 
striving is making itself felt. The new issues have
brought forth new ideas of freedom, politics, industry
and society at large. The new Negro living in this new
world is just as responsive to these new impulses as other
people are.

In the “good old days” it was quite easy to tell the
Negro to follow in the footsteps of those who had gone
before. The mere mention of the name Lincoln or the
Republican party was sufficient to secure his allegiance
to that party which had seen him stripped of all political
power and of civil rights without protest&mdash;effective or
otherwise.

Things are different now. The new Negro is demanding 
elective representation in Baltimore, Chicago and
other places. He is demanding it in New York. The
pith of the present occasion is, that he is no longer begging 
or asking. He is demanding as a right that which
he is in position to enforce.

In the presence of this new demand the old political
leaders are bewildered, and afraid; for the old idea of
Negro leadership by virtue of the white man’s selection
has collapsed. The new Negro leader must be chosen by
his fellows&mdash;by those whose strivings he is supposed to
represent.

Any man today who aspires to lead the Negro race
must set squarely before his face the idea of “Race First”
Just as the white men of these and other lands are white
men before they are Christians, Anglo-Saxons or Republicans; 
so the Negroes of this and other lands are intent
upon being Negroes before they are Christians, Englishmen, 
or Republicans.

Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Charity
begins at home, and our first duty is to ourselves. It is
not what we wish but what we must, that we are concerned 
with. The world, as it ought to be, is still for us,
as for others, the world that does not exist. The world
as it is, is the real world, and it is to that real world that
we address ourselves. Striving to be men, and finding no
effective aid in government or in politics, the Negro of
the Western world must follow the path of the Swadesha
movement of India and the Sinn Fein movement of
Ireland. The meaning of both these terms is “ourselves
first.” This is the mental background of the new politics
of the New Negro, and we commend it to the consideration 
of all the political parties. For it is upon this background 
that we will predicate such policies as shall seem
to us necessary and desirable.

In the British Parliament the Irish Home Rule party
clubbed its full strength and devoted itself so exclusively
to the cause of Free Ireland that it virtually dictated for
a time the policies of Liberals and Conservatives alike.
The new Negro race in America will not achieve political 
self-respect until it is in a positon to organize itself as
politically independent party and follow the example
of the Irish Home Rulers. This is what will happen in
American politics. &mdash;September, 1917.

### The Drift in Politics

The Negroes of America&mdash;those of them who think&mdash;are 
suspicious of everything that comes from the white
people of America. They have seen that every movement
for the extension of democracy here has broken down as
soon as it reached the color line. Political democracy
declared that “all men are created equal,” meant only all
white men; the Christian church found that the brotherhood 
of man did not include God’s bastard children; the
public school system proclaimed that the school house
was the backbone of democracy&mdash;“for white people only,”
and the civil service says that Negroes must keep their
place&mdash;at the bottom. So that they can hardly be blamed
for looking askance at any new gospel of freedom. Freedom 
to them has been like one of


<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">“those juggling fiends</div>
<div class="verse">That palter with us in a double sense;</div>  
<div class="verse">That keep the word of promise to our ear,</div>
<div class="verse">And break it to our hope.”</div>
</div>
</div>

In this connection, some explanation of the former
political solidarity of those Negroes who were voters may
be of service. Up to six years ago the one great obstacle
to the political progress of the colored people was their
sheep-like allegiance to the Republican party. They were
taught to believe that God had raised up a peculiar race
of men called Republicans who had loved the slaves so
tenderly that they had taken guns in their hands and
rushed on the ranks of the southern slaveholders to free
the slaves; that this race of men was still in existence,
marching under the banner of the Republican party and
showing their great love for Negroes by appointing from
six to sixteen near-Negroes to soft political snaps. Today
that great political superstition is falling to pieces before
the advance of intelligence among Negroes. They begin
to realize that they were sold out by the Republican party
in 1876; that in the last twenty-five years lynchings have
increased, disfranchisement has spread all over the South
and “Jim-crow” cars run even into the national capitol&mdash;with 
the continuing consent of a Republican Congress,
a Republican Supreme Court and Republican President.

Ever since the Brownsville affair, but more clearly since
Taft declared and put in force the policy of pushing out
the few near-Negro officeholders, the rank and file have
come to see that the Republican party is a great big sham.
Many went over to the Democratic party because, as the
*Amsterdam News* puts it, “They had nowhere else to go.”
Twenty years ago the colored men who joined that party
were ostracized as scalawags and crooks. But today, the
defection to the Democrats of such men as Bishop
Walters, Wood, Morton, Carr and Langston&mdash;whose
uncle was a colored Republican Congressman from Virginia&mdash;has 
made the colored democracy respectable and
given quite a tone to political heterdoxy.

All this loosens the bonds of their allegiance and breaks
the bigotry of the last forty years. But of this change in
their political view-point the white world knows nothing.
The two leading Negro newspapers are subsidized by the
same political pirates who own the title-deeds to the
handful of hirelings holding office in the name of the
Negro race. One of these papers is an organ of Mr.
Washington, the other pretends to be independent&mdash;that
is, it must be bought on the installment plan, and both of
them are in New York. Despite this “conspiracy of
silence” the Negroes are waking up, are beginning to
think for themselves, to look with more favor on “new
doctrines.” ^[The first part of this editorial is reprinted from an article written in 1912.]

Today the politician who wants the support of the
Negro voter will have to give something more than piecrust 
promises. The old professional “friend to the
colored people” must have something more solid than the
name of Lincoln and party appointments.

We demand what the Irish and the Jewish voter get:
nominations on the party’s ticket in our own districts.
And if we don’t get this we will smash the party that
refuses to give it.

For we are not Republicans, Democrats or Socialists
any longer. We are Negroes first. And we are no longer
begging for sops. We demand, not “recognition,” but
representation, and we are out to throw our votes to any
party which gives us this, and withhold them from any
party which refuses to give it. No longer will we follow
any leader whose job the party controls. For we know
that no leader so controlled can oppose such party in
our interests beyond a given point.

That is why so much interest attaches to the mass-meeting 
to be held at Palace Casino on the 29th where
the Citizens’ Committee will make its report to the Negro
voters of Harlem and tell them how it was “turned down”
by the local representatives of the Republican party when
it begged the boon of elective representation. All such
rebuffs will make for manhood-if we are men and will
drive us to play in American politics the same role which
the Irish party played in British politics. That is the new
trend in Negro politics, and we must not let any party
forget it. &mdash;1917.

### A Negro for President

For many years the Negro has been the football of
American politics. Kicked from pillar to post, he goes
begging, hat in hand, from a Republican convention to a
Democratic one. Always is he asking some one else to
do something for him. Always is he begging, pleading,
demanding or threatening. In all these cases his dependence 
is on the good will, sense of justice or gratitude of
the other fellow. And in none of these cases is the
political reaction of the other fellow within the control
of the Negro.

But a change for the better is approaching. Four years
ago, the present writer was propounding in lectures, indoors and outdoors, the thesis that the Negro people of
America would never amount to anything much politically
until they should see fit to imitate the Irish of Britain and
to organize themselves into a political party of their own
whose leaders, on the basis of this large collective vote,
could “hold up” Republicans, Democrats, Socialists or
any other political group of American whites. As in
many other cases, we have lived to see time ripen the
fruits of our own thought for some one else to pluck.
Here is the editor of the *Challenge* making a campaign
along these very lines. His version of the idea takes the
form of advocating the nomination of a Negro for the
Presidency of the United States. In this form we haven’t
the slightest doubt that this idea will meet with a great
deal of ridicule and contempt. Nevertheless, we venture
to prophesy that, whether in the hands of Mr. Bridges or
another, it will come to be ultimately accepted as one of
the finest contributions to Negro statesmanship.

No one pretends, of course, that the votes of Negroes
can elect a Negro to the high office of President of the
United States. Nor would any one expect that the votes
of white people will be forthcoming to assist them in such
a project. The only way in which a Negro could be
elected President of the United States would be by virtue
of the voters not knowing that the particular candidate
was of Negro ancestry. This, we believe, has already
happened within the memory of living men. But, the
essential intent of this new plan is to furnish a focussing-point 
around which the ballots of the Negro voters may
be concentrated for the realization of racial demands for
justice and equality of opportunity and treatment. It
would be carrying “Race First” with a vengeance into the
arena of domestic politics. It would take the Negro voter
out of the ranks of the Republican, Democratic and
Socialist parties and would enable their leaders to trade
the votes of their followers, openly and above-board, for
those things for which masses of men largely exchange
their votes.

Mr. Bridges will find that the idea of a Negro candidate
for President presupposes the creation of a purely Negro
party and upon that prerequisite he will find himself
compelled to concentrate. Doubtless, most of the political
wise-acres of the Negro race will argue that the idea is
impossible because it antagonizes the white politicians
of the various parties. They will close their eyes to the
fact that politics implies antagonism and a conflict of
interest. They will fail to see that the only things which
count with politicians are votes, and that, just as one
white man will cheerfully cut another white man’s throat
to get the dollars which a black man has, so will one
white politician or party cut another one’s throat politically 
to get the votes which black men may cast at the
polls. But these considerations will finally carry the day.
Let there be no mistake. The Negro will never be accepted 
by the white American democracy except in so far
as he can by the use of force, financial, political or other,
win, seize or maintain in the teeth of opposition that
position which he finds necessary to his own security and
salvation. And we Negroes may as well make up our
minds now that we can’t depend upon the good-will of
white men in anything or at any point where our interests
and theirs conflict. Disguise it as we may, in business,
politics, education or other departments of life, we as
Negroes are compelled to fight for what we want to win
from the white world.

It is easy enough for those colored men whose
psychology is shaped by their white inheritance to argue
the ethics of compromise and inter-racial co-operation.
But we whose brains are still unbastardized must face
the frank realities of this situation of racial conflict and
competition. Wherefore, it is well that we marshal our
forces to withstand and make head against the constant
racial pressure. Action and reaction are equal and
opposite. Where there is but slight pressure a slight
resistance will suffice. But where, as in our case, that
pressure is grinding and pitiless, the resistance that would
re-establish equal conditions of freedom must of necessity
be intense and radical. And it is this philosophy which
must furnish the motive for such a new and radical
departure as is implied in the joint idea of a Negro party
in American politics and a Negro candidate for the
Presidency of these United States. &mdash;June, 1920.

### When the Tail Wags the Dog

Politically, these United States may be roughly divided
into two sections, so far as the Negroes are concerned.
In the North the Negro population has the vote. In the
South it hasn’t. This was not always so.

There was a time when the Negro voters of the South sent in to Congress 
a thin but steady stream of black men who represented 
their political interests directly. Due to the misadventures 
of the reconstruction period, this stream was
shut off until at the beginning of this century George
White, of North Carolina, was the sole and last representative 
of the black man with a ballot in the South.

This result was due largely to the characteristic
stupidity of the Negro voter. He was a Republican, he
was. He would do anything with his ballot for Abraham
Lincoln&mdash;who was dead&mdash;but not a thing for himself and
his family, who were all alive and kicking. For this the
Republican party loved him so much that it permitted the
Democrats to disfranchise him while it controlled Congress
and the courts, the army and navy, and all the
machinery of law-enforcement in the United States. With
its continuing consent, Jim-crowism, disfranchisement,
segregation and lynching spread abroad over the land.
The end of it all was the reduction of the Negro in the
South to the position of a political serf, an industrial
peon and a social outcast.

Recently there has been developed in the souls of black
folk a new manhood dedicated to the proposition that, if
all Americans are equal in the matter of baring their
breasts to foreign bayonets, then all Americans must, by
their own efforts, be made equal in balloting for Presidents 
and other officers of the government. This principle
is compelling the Republican party in certain localities to
consider the necessity of nominating Negroes on its local
electoral tickets. Yet the old attitude of that party on
the political rights of Negroes remains substantially the
same.

Here, for instance, is the Chicago convention, at which
the Negro delegates were lined up to do their duty by the
party. Of course, these delegates had to deal collectively
with the white leaders. This was to their mutual advantage. 
But the odd feature of the entire affair was this,
that, *Whereas the Negro people in the South are not
free to cast their votes, it was precisely from these voteless 
areas that the national Republican leaders selected
the political spokesmen for the voting Negroes of the
North.* Men who will not vote at the coming election and
men who, like Roscoe Simmons, never cast a vote in their
lives were the accredited representatives in whose hands
lay the destiny of a million Negro voters.

But there need be no fear that this insult will
annoy the black brother in the Republican ranks. A
Negro Republican generally runs the rhinoceros and the
elephant a close third. In plain English, the average
Negro Republican is too stupid to see and too meek to
mind. Then, too, here is Fate’s retribution for the black
man in the North who has never cared enough to fight
(the Republican party) for the political freedom of his
brother in the South, but left him to rot under poll-tax
laws and grandfather clauses. The Northern white
Democrats, for letting their Southern brethren run riot
through the Constitution, must pay the penalty of being
led into the ditch by the most ignorant, stupid and vicious
portion of their party. Even so, the Northern Negro
Republican, for letting his Southern brother remain a
political ragamuffin, must now stomach the insult of this
same ragamuffin dictating the destiny of the freer Negroes
of the North. In both cases the tail doth wag the dog
because of “the solid South.” Surely, “the judgments
of the Lord are true and righteous altogether!” &mdash;July,
1920.

### The Grand Old Party

In the early days of 1861, when the Southern Senators
and Representatives were relinquishing their seats in the
United States Congress and hurling cartels of defiant
explanation broadcast, the Republican party in Congress,
under the leadership of Charles Francis Adams of Massachusetts,
organized a joint committee made up of
thirteen members of the Senate and thirty-three members
of the House to make overtures to the seceding Southerners. 
The result of this friendly gesture was a proposed
thirteenth amendment, which, if the Southerners had not
been so obstinate, would have bridged the chasm. For
this amendment proposed to make the slavery of the
black man in America eternal and inescapable. It provided 
that no amendment to the Constitution, or any other
proposition affecting slavery in any way, could ever be
legally presented upon the floor of Congress unless its
mover had secured the previous consent of *every Senator
and Representative from the slave-holding States*. It put
teeth into the Fugitive Slave Law and absolutely gave the
Negro over into the keeping of his oppressors.

Most Negro Americans (and white ones, too) think it
fashionable to maintain the most fervid faith and deepest
ignorance about points in their national history of which
they should be informed. We therefore submit that these
facts are open and notorious to those who know American 
history. The record will be found slimly and shame-facedly 
given in McPherson’s “History of the Rebellion”;
at indignant length in Blaine’s “Twenty Years of Congress” 
and Horace Greeley’s “The Great American Conflict.” 
The document can be examined in Professor Macdonald’s 
“Select Documents of United States History.”
These works are to be found in every public library, and
we refer to them here because there are “intellectual”
Negroes today who are striving secretly, when they dare
not do so openly, to perpetuate the bonds of serfdom
which bind the Negro Americans to the Republican party.
This bond of serfdom, this debt of gratitude, is supposed
to hinge on the love which Abraham Lincoln and his party
are supposed to have borne towards the Negro; and the
object of this appeal to the historical record is to show
that that record demonstrates that if the Negro owes any
debt to the Republican party it is a debt of execration and
of punishment rather than one of gratitude.

It is an astounding fact that in his First Inaugural
Address Abraham Lincoln gave his explicit approval to
the substance of the Crittenden resolutions which the
joint committee referred to above had collectively taken
over. This demonstrates that the Republican party at
the very beginning of its contact with the Negro was
willing to sell the Negro, bound hand and foot, for the
substance of its own political control. This Thirteenth
Amendment was adopted by six or eight Northern States,
including Pennsylvania and Illinois; and if Fort Sumter
had not been fired upon it would have become by State
action the law of the land.

The Republican party did not fight for the freedom of
the Negro, but for the maintenance of its own grip on the
government which the election of Abraham Lincoln had
secured. If any one wants to know for what the Republican 
party fought he will find it in such facts as this:
That thousands of square miles of the people’s property
were given away to Wall Street magnates who had corrupted 
the Legislature in their effort to build railroads on
the government’s money. The sordid story is given in
“Forty Years in Wall Street,” by the banker, Henry
Clews, and others who took part in this raid upon the
resources of a great but stupid people.

But the Civil War phase of the Republican party’s
treason to the Negro is not the only outstanding one, as
was shown by the late General Tremaine in his “Sectionalism 
Unmasked.” Not only was General Grant elected in
1868 by the newly created Negro vote, as the official
records prove, but his re-election in 1872 was effected by
the same means. So was the election of Rutherford B.
Hayes in 1876. Yet when the election of Hayes had been
taken before the overwhelmingly Republican Congress
this shameless party made a deal whereby, in order to
pacify the white “crackers” of the South, the Negro was
given over into the hands of the triumphant Ku-Klux; the
soldiers who protected their access to the ballot box in
the worst southern states were withdrawn, while the
“crackers” agreed as the price of this favor to withdraw
their opposition to the election of Hayes. For this there
exists ample proof which will be presented upon the challenge 
of any politician or editor. As a Republican Senator
from New England shamelessly said, it was a matter of
“Root, hog, or die” for the helpless Negro whose ballots
had buttressed the Republican party’s temple of graft and
corruption. So was reconstruction settled against the
Negro by the aid and abetting of the Republican party.

And since that time lynching, disfranchisement and
segregation have grown with the Republican party in
continuous control of the government from 1861 to 1920&mdash;with 
the exception of eight years of Woodrow Wilson
and eight years of Grover Cleveland. With their continuing 
consent the South has been made solid, so that
at every Republican convention delegates who do not
represent a voting constituency but a grafting collection
of white postmasters and their Negro lackeys can turn
the scales of nomination in favor of any person whom
the central clique of the party, controlled as it has always
been by Wall Street financiers, may foist upon a disgusted
people, as they have done in the case of Harding. So
long as the South remains solid, so long will the 
Republican delegates from the South consist of only this handful
of hirelings; so long will they be amenable to the “discipline” 
which means the pressure of the jobs by which
they get their bread. Therefore the Republican leaders
will know that the solidarity of the South is their most
valuable asset; and they are least likely to do anything
that will break that solidarity. The Republican party’s only
interest in the Negro is to get his vote for nothing; and
so long as Negro Republican leaders remain the contemptible 
grafters and political procurers that they are
at present, so long will it get Negro votes for nothing.

Through it all the Republican party remains the most
corrupt influence among Negro Americans. It buys up
by jobs, appointments and gifts those Negroes who in
politics should be the free and independent spokesmen of
Negro Americans. But worse than this is its private work
in which it secretly subsidizes men who pose before the
public as independent radicals. These intellectual pimps
draw private supplementary incomes from the Republican
party to sell out the influence of any movement, church
or newspaper with which they are connected. Of the
enormity of this mode of procedure and the extent to
which it saps the very springs of Negro integrity the
average Negro knows nothing. Its blighting, baleful influence 
is known only to those who have trained ears to
hear and trained eyes to see.

And now in this election the standards will advance and
the cohorts go forward under the simple impulse of the
same corrupting influence. But whether the new movement 
for a Negro party comes to a head or not, the new
Negro in America will never amount to anything politically 
until he enfranchises himself from the Grand Old
Party which has made a political joke of him. &mdash;July,
1920.
