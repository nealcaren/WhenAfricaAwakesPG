## CHAPTER IX.<br>A FEW BOOKS.

### The Negro in History and Civilization

<p class="reviewedauthor">(From Superman to Man, by J. A. Rogers.)</p>

This volume by Mr. Rogers is the greatest little book on the
Negro that we remember to have read. It makes no great
parade of being “scientific,” as so many of our young writers
do who seem to think that science consists solely in logical
analysis. If science consists fundamentally of facts, of information 
and of principles derived from those facts, then the volume
before us is one of the most scientific that has been produced by
a Negro writer. It sweeps the circle of all the social sciences.
History, sociology, anthropology, psychology, economics and politics&mdash;even 
theology&mdash;are laid under contribution and yield
a store of information which is worked up into a presentation 
so plain and clear that the simplest can read
and understand it, and yet so fortified by proofs from the greatest
standard authorities of the past and present that there is no
joint in its armor in which the keenest spear of a white scientist
may enter.

Unlike an older type of scholar (now almost extinct) the
author does not go to vapid verbal philosophers or devotional
dreamers for the facts of history and ethnology. He goes to
historians and ethnologists for them and to anthropologists for
his anthropology. The result is information which stands the
searching tests of any inquirer who chooses to doubt and investigate 
before accepting what is set before him.

From this book the unlearned reader of the African race
can gather proof that his race has not always been a subject
or inferior race. He has the authority of Professor Reisner,
of Harvard; of Felix Dubois, Volney, Herodotus, Finot, Sergi,
the modern Egyptologists and the scholars of the white world who
assembled at the Universal Races Congress in London in 1911,
for the belief that his race has founded great civilizations, has
ruled over areas as large as all Europe, and was prolific in statesmen, 
scientists, poets, conquerors, religious and political leaders,
arts and crafts, industry and commerce when the white race was
wallowing in barbarism or sunk in savagery. Here he can learn
on good authority, from St. Jerome and Cicero, Herodotus and
Homer down to the modern students of race history, that cannibalism 
has been a practise among white populations like the
Scythians, Scots and Britons; that the white races have been
slaves; that here in America the slavery of white men was a
fact as late as the 19th century, and “according to Professor
Cigrand, Grover Cleveland’s grandfather, Richard Falley, was an
Irish slave in Connecticut.” In short, he will learn here, not that
newspaper science which keeps even “educated” Americans so
complacently ignorant, but the science of the scientists themselves. 
He will learn all that this kind of science has to tell of
the relative capacity and standing of the black and white races&mdash;and much of it will surprise him. But all of it will please and instruct.

The book also deals with the facts of the present position of
the Negro in America and the West Indies; with questions of
religion, education, politics and political parties, war work,
lynching, miscegenation on both sides, the beauty of Negro
women and race prejudice. And on everyone of these topics
it gives a minimum of opinion and a maximum of information.
This information flows forth during the course of a series of discussions 
between an educated Negro Pullman porter and a
Southern white statesman on a train running between Chicago
and San Francisco. The superior urbanity of the Negro, coupled
with his wider information and higher intelligence, eventually
wins over the Caucasian to admit that the whole mental attitude
of himself and his race in regard to the Negro was wrong and
based on nothing better than prejudice.

This conversational device gives the author an opportunity to
present all the conflicting views on both sides of the Color Line,
and the result is a wealth of information which makes this book
a necessity on the bookshelf of everyone, Negro or Caucasian,
who has some use for knowledge on the subject of the Negro.
The book is published by the author at 4700 State Street,
Chicago.

### “Darkwater”
<p class="reviewedauthor">By W. E. B. Du Bois.</p>

An unwritten law has existed for a long time to the effect
that the critical estimates which fix the status of a book by a
Negro author shall be written by white men. Praise or blame&mdash;.
the elementary criticism which expresses only the reviewer’s
feelings in reference to the book&mdash;has generally been the sole
function of the Negro critic. And the results have not been
good. For, in the first place, white critics (except in music)
have been too prone to judge the product of a Negro author as
Dr. Johnson judged the dancing dog: “It isn’t at all like dancing;
but then, one shouldn’t expect more from a dog.” That is
why many Negro poets of fifth grade merit are able to marshal
ecomiums by the bushel from friendly white critics who ought
to know better. On the other hand, there is the danger of
disparagement arising solely from racial prejudice and the
Caucasian refusal to take Negro literary products seriously.

In either case the work fails to secure consideration solely
on its merits. Wherefore, it is high time that competent appraisal 
of Negro books should come from “our side of the
street.” But, then, the Negro reading public should be taught
what to expect, viz., that criticism is neither “knocking” nor
“boosting”; but an attempt, in the first place, to furnish a correct
and adequate idea of the scope and literary method of the book
under review, of the author’s success in realizing his objects, and
of the spirit in which he does his work. In the second place,
the critic should be expected to bring his own understanding of
the subject matter of the book to bear upon the problem of
enlightening the readers’ understanding, that at the end the
reader may decide whether the work is worth his particular
while.

This book of Dr. Du Bois’ is one which challenges the swing
of seasoned judgment and appraisal. It challenges also free
thinking and plain speaking. For, at the very outset,
find ourselves forced to demur to the publishers’
assumptions as to its author’s status. “Even more than
the late Booker Washington, Mr. Du Bois is now chief
spokesman of the two hundred million men and women of
African blood.” So say the publishers&mdash;or the author. But
this is outrageously untrue. Once upon a time Dr. Du Bois
held a sort of spiritual primacy among The Talented Tenth, not
at all comparable to that of Booker Washington in scope, but
vital and compelling for all that. The power of that leadership,
however, instead of increasing since Mr. Washington’s death,
has decreased, and is now openly flouted by the most active and
outspoken members of The Talented Tenth in Negro America.
And, outside of the twelve or fifteen millions “of African blood”
in the United States, the mass of that race in South and West
Africa, Egypt and the Philippines know, unfortunately, very
little of Dr. Du Bois. It may be, however, that this is merely
a publishers’ rhodomontade.

And it is the publishers themselves who challenge for this
volume a comparison with “The Souls of Black Folk,” which
was published by McClurg in 1903. It is regrettable that they
should force the issue, for “The Souls of Black Folk” is a
greater book than “Darkwater” in many ways. In the first
place, its high standard of craftsmanship is maintained through
every chapter and page. There are no fag-ends, as in the chapter
“Of Beauty and Death” in the present volume, where the rhetoric
bogs down, the author loses the thread of his purpose and
goes spieling off into space, spinning a series of incongruous
purple patches whose tawdry glitter shows the same reversion
to crude barbarism in taste which leads a Florida fieldhand to
don opal-colored trousers, a pink tie, pari-colored shirt and
yellow shoes. Artistically, that chapter is an awful thing, and
I trust that the author is artist enough to be ashamed of it.

And, though it may savor of anti-climax, “The Souls of
Black Folk” was more artistically “gotten” up&mdash;to use the grammar 
of its author. “Darkwater” is cheaply bound and cheaply
printed on paper which is almost down to the level of the Seaside 
Library. Neither in mechanical nor mental quality does the
book of 1920 come up to the level of that of 1903.

Yet, in spite of some defects, “Darkwater” (with the exception 
of chapters six, seven, eight and nine) is a book well worth
reading. It is a collection of papers written at different times,
between 1908 and 1920, and strung loosely on the string of race.
One wishes that the author could have included his earlier essay
on The Talented Tenth and his address on the aims and ideals
of modern education, delivered some twelve years ago to the
colored school children of Washington, D. C.

Each paper makes a separate chapter, and each chapter is
followed by a rhetorical sprig of symbolism in prose or verse in
which the tone-color of the preceding piece is made manifest
to the reader. Of these tone-poems in prose and verse, the best
are the Credo; A Litany at Atlanta; The Riddle of the Sphinx,
and Jesus Christ in Texas. In these the lyrical quality of the
author’s prose is lifted to high levels. In these elegance does
not slop over into turgid declamation and rhetorical claptrap&mdash;which 
has become a common fault of the author’s recent prose
as shown in The Crisis. In this, the first part of the book, the
work is genuine and its rhetoric rings true. Nevertheless, the
sustained artistic swing of “The Souls of Black Folk,” which
placed that work (as a matter of form and style) on the level
of Edgar Saltus’ *Imperial Purple*&mdash;this is not attained in “Darkwater.”

The book may be said to deal largely with the broad international 
aspects of the problem of the color line and its reactions 
on statecraft, welt-politik, international peace and international 
trade, industry, education and the brotherhood of man.
Each chapter, or paper, is devoted to one of these reactions.
Then there is a charming autobiographical paper, “The Shadow
of Years,” which first appeared in The Crisis about three years
ago, in which we have the study of a soul by itself. The growth
of the author’s mind under the bewildering shadow cast by the
color line is tragically set forth. I say tragically with deliberation; 
for what we see here, despite its fine disguise, is the
smoldering resentment of a mulatto who finds the beckoning
white doors of the world barred on his approach. One senses
the thought that, if they had remained open, the gifted spirit
would have entered and made his home within them. *Mais, chacun
a son gout*, and no one has the right to quarrel with the author
on that doubtful score.

In the chapter on “The Souls of White Folk” we have a
fine piece, not so much of analysis, as of exposition. The author
puts his best into it. And yet that best seems to have failed to
bite with acid brutality into the essential iron of the white
man’s soul. For the basic elements of that soul are Hypocrisy,
Greed and Cruelty. True, the author brings this out; but he
doesn’t burn it in. The indictment is presented in terms of an
appeal to shocked sensibilities and a moral sense which exists,
for the white man, only in print; whereas it might have been
made in other terms which come nearer to his self-love. Nevertheless 
it is unanswerable in its logic.

In “The Hands of Ethiopia,” as in “The Souls of White Folk,”
we catch the stern note of that threat which (disguise it as
our journals will), the colored races are making, of an ultimate
appeal in terms of color and race to the white man’s only God&mdash;the
God of Armed Force. But the author never reaches the
height of that newer thought&mdash;an international alliance of
Black, Brown and Yellow against the arrogance of White.

In “Work and Wealth” and “The Servant in the House” the
problems of work and its reward, and the tragedy of that reward,
are grippingly set forth in relation to the Negro in America and
in the civilized world. “The Ruling of Men” is followed
by three papers of very inferior merit and the book ends with a
fantastic short story, “The Comet” which, like “The Coming of
John” in “The Souls of Black Folk,” suggests that Dr. Du Bois
could be a compelling writer of this shorter form of fiction.
The touch in this story of incident is light, but arresting.

Dr. Du Bois, in the looseness of phrase current in our time
in America, is called a scholar&mdash;on what grounds we are not
informed. But Dr. Du Bois is not a scholar; his claim to consideration 
rests upon a different basis, but one no less high.
And when the Negro culture of the next century shall assay
the products of our own it will seem remarkable that this supreme 
wizard of words, this splendid literary artist, should
have left his own demesne to claim the crown of scholarship.
Surely, there is honest credit enough in being what he is, our
foremost man of culture. And this “Darkwater,” despite its
lapses from artistic grace, helps to rivet his claim to that consideration. 
It is a book which will well repay reading.

### The Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy

<p class="reviewedauthor">By Lothrop Stoddard</p>

About ten years ago Mr. B. L. Putnam Weale in “The Conflict
of Color” tried to open the eyes of the white men of the world
to the fact that they were acting as their own grave diggers.
About the same time Mr. Melville E. Stone, president of the
Associated Press, in an address before the Quill Club on “Race
Prejudice in the Far East” reinforced the same grisly truth. Five
years later “T. Shirby Hodge” wrote “The White Man’s Burden:
A Satirical Forecast,” and ended it with these pregnant words:
“The white man’s burden is&mdash;himself.” His publishers practically
suppressed his book, which, by the way, should have been in the
library of every intelligent Negro. The white world was indisposed 
then to listen to its voices of warning. But today the
physical, economic and racial ravages of the World War have
so changed the white world’s mind that within four weeks of its
appearance “The Rising Tide of Color Against White World
Supremacy,” by Lothrop Stoddard, has struck the bull’s-eye of
attention and has already become the most widely talked-of book
of the year. White men of power are discussing its facts and
its conclusions with bated breath and considerable disquietude.

Here is a book written by a white man which causes white men
to shiver. For it calls their attention to the writing on the wall.
It proves that the white race in its mad struggle for dominion
over others has been exhausting its vital resources and is exhausting 
them further. It proves to the hilt the thesis advanced in 1917
in my brief essay on “The White War and the Colored Races”
that, whereas the white race was on top by virtue of its guns, ships,
money, intellect and massed man-power, in the World War it
was busy burning up, depleting and destroying these very resources 
on which its primacy depended. But even though the
white capitalists knew all this their mad greed was still their
master. This great race is still so low spiritually that it sells
even its racial integrity for dollars and cents. Mr. Stoddard’s
book may disturb its sense of security for a brief space, but
it cannot keep white “civilization” from its mad dance of death.
“What shall it profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose
his own soul?” And the white race will finally find that this
is even more true racially than individually.

We have noticed for many years that whereas domestic journalism 
was merely journalism&mdash;the passing register of parochial
sensations&mdash;the journalism of the international publicists like
Lord Bryce, Meredith Townsend, Archibald Colquhoon, Putnam
Weale and Hyndman was something more solid than journalism.
In the writings of these men hard fact and stark reality are
wedded to wide reading and deep thinking. They are the real
social scientists rather than the stay-at-home, cloistered sociologists 
who, presuming to know everything, have seen nothing.
The present volume is one of the best of the former and is full of
the qualities of its class. But at the very outset it suffers from
the unwelcome assistance of Dr. Madison Grant, “chairman of the
New York Zoological Society and trustee of the American
Museum of Natural History.” Dr. Grant has accumulated a
large stock of musty ethnological ideas of which he unburdens
himself in what he evidently intends as a “learned” introduction,
without which freightage the book would be much better. The
difference in value and accuracy between Mr. Stoddard’s text and
the pseudo-scientific introduction of Dr. Grant would furnish
fair material for philosophic satire. Unfortunately we cannot
indulge the inclination in the columns of a weekly newspaper.

Dr. Grant, in owlish innocence, splutters out the usual futile
folly which (in other domains) has brought the white race to
the frontiers of the present crisis. He reads back into history
the racial values of today and trails the Anglo-Saxon’s crass conceit 
and arrogance across the pages of its record, finding “contrast 
of mental and spiritual endowments ... elusive of
definition,” and other racial clap-trap whose falsity has been
demonstrated again and again by warm-hearted enthusiasts like
Jean Finot and coldly critical and scientific scholars like Dr.
Taylor (“Origin of the Aryans”), Sergi (“The Mediterranean
Race”) and J. M. Robertson (“The Evolution of States”). But
one can forgive Dr. Grant; he is a good American, and good
Americans (especially “scientists” on race) are usually fifty
years behind the English, who, in turn, are usually twenty years
behind the Germans. Dr. Grant’s annexation of the past history
of human culture to the swollen record of the whites sounds
good&mdash;even if it smells bad. And he is in good Anglo-Saxon
company. Sir Harry Johnston does the same thing and gets titles
(scientific and other) by so doing. The Englishman takes the
very Egyptians, Hindus and tribal Liberians, whom he would
call “niggers” in New York and London, and as soon as he finds
that they have done anything worth while he tags them with a
“white” tag. Thus, to the professional “scientist” like Dr. Grant,
living in the parochial atmosphere of the United States, science
is something arcane, recondite and off the earth; while to the
American like Mr. Stoddard, who has been broadened by travel
and contact with the wider world, science, is, as it should be,
organized daily knowledge and common sense. Thus journalists,
good and bad, are the ones who form opinion in America, because 
“scientists” are so distressingly stupid.

Mr. Stoddard’s thesis starts from the proposition that of the
seventeen hundred million people on our earth today the great
majority is made up of black, brown, red and yellow people. The
white race, being in the minority, still dominates over the lands
of black, brown, red and (in the case of China) has assumed
a right of dictatorship and disposal even in the yellow man’s
lands. In the course of this dictatorship and domination the
white race has erected the barrier of the color line to keep the
other races in their place. But this barrier is cracking and giving
way at many points and the flood of racial self-assertion, hitherto
dammed up, threatens to overflow the outer and inner dikes and
sweep away the domination of the whites.

The author approaches his theme with a curiously graduated
respect for other races. This respect, while it is a novelty in the
attitude of the blond overlords, is always in direct proportion
to the present power and discernible potentialities of the races
discussed. For the yellow man of Japan and China he shows
the greatest deference. The browns (of India, Persia, Afghanistan, 
Egypt and the Mohammedan world in general) are, of
course, inferior, but must be respected for their militancy. The
reds (the original American stock which is the backbone of the
population of Mexico, Central and South America) are a source
of contamination for white blood and an infernal nuisance,
capable of uniting with Japan and China in an onslaught on the
land areas reserved for white exploitation in the western world;
while the blacks, at the foot of the ladder, have never amounted
to anything, don’t amount to anything now, and can never
seriously menace the superiority of the whites.

The gradation is full of meaning, especially to those fervid
theorists who affect to believe that religion, morality, loyalty and
good citizenship constitute a good claim to the white man’s
respect. For it is Japan’s actual military might and China’s
impending military might which have put them in Grade A,
while the brown man’s show of resistance in Egypt, India
and elsewhere under Islam, and his general physical unrest and
active discontent have secured for him a classification in Grade
B. The American in Mexico and South America keeps his window 
open toward the east; but the black man still seems, in our
author’s eyes, to be the same loyal, gentle, stupid beast of burden
that the white man’s history has known&mdash;except in those parts
of Africa in which he has accepted the Mohammedan religion and
thus become a part of the potential terror of the Moslem world.
In this we think our author mistaken; but, after all, it is neither
arguments nor logic that will determine these matters, but deeds
and accomplishments.

But, however his racial respect may be apportioned, Mr. Stoddard 
holds that his race is doomed. “If the present drift be not
changed we whites are all ultimately doomed. Unless we set our
house in order the doom will sooner or later overtake us all.”
The present reviewer stakes his money on “the doom,” for the
white race’s disease is an ingrowing one whose development.
inheres in their very nature. They are so singularly constituted
that they would rather tear themselves to pieces parading as the
lords of creation than see any other people achieve an equal
favor of fortune.

In the pages of this book the author presents many chastening
truths and wide vistas of international politics which are enlightening 
when carefully studied. But it is not our intent to cover the
entire field of his work, and we think that we have said enough
to indicate the high value and suggestiveness of the work. But
we may be allowed to point out that all the way through the
author, though clear and enlightened, remains an unreconstructed
Anglo-Saxon, desirous of opening the eyes of his race to the
dangers which beset them through their racial injustice and
arrogance; but sternly, resolutely, intent that they shall not
share their overlordship with any other of the sons of earth.
His book is written in a clear and commendable style; he shows
but few defects of temper and a shrewd mastery of his materials. 
The book should be widely read by intelligent men of
color from Tokio to Tallahassee. It is published by Charles
Scribner’s Sons at $3, and is well worth the price.
