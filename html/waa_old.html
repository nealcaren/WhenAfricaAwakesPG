<h2 id="introductory">INTRODUCTORY</h2>
<p>The Great War of 1914–1918 has served to liberate many new ideas
undreamt of by those who rushed humanity into that bath of blood. During
that war the idea of democracy was widely advertised, especially in the
English-speaking world; mainly as a convenient camouflage behind which
competing imperialists masked their sordid aims. Even the dullest can
now see that those who so loudly proclaimed and formulated the new
democratic demands never had the slightest intention of extending either
the limits or the applications of “democracy.” Ireland and India, Egypt
and Russia are still the Ithuriel’s spear of the great democratic
pretence. The flamboyant advertising of “democracy” has returned to
plague the inventors; for the subject populations who contributed their
millions in men and billions in treasure for the realization of the
ideal which was flaunted before their eyes are now clamoring for their
share of it. They are demanding that those who advertised democracy
shall now make good. This is the main root of that great unrest which is
now troubling the decrepit statesmanship of Europe and America. But the
rigid lines of the old regime will not permit the granting of these new
demands. Hence the new war against democracy which expresses itself in
the clever but futile attempt to outlaw the demands for fuller freedom
as “sedition” and “Bolshevism.”</p>
<p>The most serious aspect of this new situation is the racial one. The
white world has been playing with the catch-words of democracy while
ruthlessly ruling an overwhelming majority of black, brown and yellow
peoples to whom these catchwords were never intended to apply. But these
many-colored millions have taken part in the war “to make the world safe
for democracy,” and they are now insisting that democracy shall be made
safe for them. This, in plain English, their white overlords do not
intend to concede. “The undictated development of all peoples” was, at
best, intended “for white people only.” Thus, white civilization is
brought face to face with a crisis out of which may easily grow military
conflicts of tremendous scope and, more remotely, the passing of
international control out of the hands of a few white nations.</p>
<p>The tenseness of this new situation has been reflected here in the
United States in the mental attitude of the Negro people. They have
developed new ideas of their own place in the category of races and have
evolved new conceptions of their powers and destiny. These ideas have
quickened their race-consciousness and they are making new demands on
themselves, on their leaders and on the white people in whose midst they
live. These new demands apply to politics, domestic and international,
to education and culture, to commerce and industry. It seems proper that
the white people of America should know what these demands are and
should understand the spirit in which they are being urged. Obviously,
it is not well that they should be misrepresented and lied about. Futile
fulminations about the spread of “Bolshevism” among Negroes by
“agitators” will not help toward an understanding of this new
phenomenon. They can but befog the issues and defer the dawning of a
better day. On the other hand, the Negro people will profit by a
clarified presentation of their own side of the case. It is to meet this
dual need that this little book is launched. It is a compilation of some
of the author’s contributions to Negro journalism between 1917 and the
present year and consists of selected editorials, special articles and
reviews written for The Voice, The New Negro, and The Negro World. I
have selected for reproduction those only which could fairly be
considered as expositions of the new point of view evolved during the
Great War and coming into prominence since the peace was signed. So far,
this point of view has not been fully presented-by the Negro. White men,
like Messrs. Sandburg and Seligman, have essayed to interpret it to the
white world. This little volume presents directly that which they would
interpret.</p>
<p>It may seem unusual to put into permanent form the deliverances of
this species of literature. But I venture to think that, as literature,
they will stand the test; and I am willing to assume the risks. Besides,
I feel that I owe it to my people to preserve this cross-section of
their new-found soul. It was my privilege to assist in shaping some of
the forms of the new consciousness; and to preserve for posterity a
portion of its record has seemed a duty which should not be shirked.</p>
<p>It was in 1916 that I first began to hammer out some of the ideas
which will be found in these pages. It was in that year that I gave up
my work as a lecturer and teacher among white people to give myself
exclusively to work among my own people. In the summer of 1917, with the
financial aid of many poor but willing hearts I brought out <em>The
Voice</em>, the first Negro journal of the new dispensation, and, for
some time, the only one. The Voice failed in March, 1919; but in the
meanwhile it had managed to make an indelible impression. Many of the
writings reproduced here are taken from its files. The others are from
<em>The Negro World</em>, of which I assumed the joint editorship in
January of this year. A few appeared in <em>The New Negro</em>, a
monthly magazine which I edited for a short time.</p>
<p>The account of the launching of the Liberty League is given here in
the first chapter because that meeting at historic Bethel on June 12,
1917, and the labors of tongue and pen out of which that meeting emerged
were the foundation for the mighty structures of racial propaganda which
have been raised since then. This is a fact not generally known because
I have not hankered after newspaper publicity.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to point out that the AFRICA of the title is
to be taken in its racial rather than in its geographical sense.</p>

<p class="reviewedauthor">
(From <em>The Voice</em> of July 4, 1917.)
</p>
<p>The Liberty League of Negro-Americans, which was recently organized
by the Negroes of New York, presents the most startling program of any
organization of Negroes in the country today. This is nothing less than
the demand that the Negroes of the United States be given a chance to
enthuse over democracy for themselves in America before they are
expected to enthuse over democracy in Europe. The League is composed of
“Negro-Americans, loyal to their country in every respect, and obedient
to her laws.”</p>
<p>The League has an interesting history. It grew out of the labors of
Mr. Hubert H. Harrison, who has been on the lecture platform for years
and is well and favorably known to thousands of white New Yorkers from
Wall Street to Washington Heights.</p>
<p>Two years ago Mr. Harrison withdrew from an international political
organization, and, a little more than a year ago, gave up lecturing to
white people, to devote himself to lecturing exclusively among his own
people. He acquired so much influence among them that when he issued the
first call for a mass-meeting “to protest against lynching in the land
of liberty and disfranchisement in the home of democracy,” although the
call was not advertised in any newspaper, the church in which the
meeting was held was packed from top to bottom. At this mass-meeting,
which was held at Bethel Church on June 12, the organization was
effected and funds were raised to sustain it and to extend its work all
over the country.</p>
<p>Harrison was subsequently elected its president, with Edgar Grey and
James Harris as secretary and treasurer, respectively. At the close of
this mass-meeting he hurriedly took the midnight train for Boston, where
a call for a similar meeting had been issued by W. Monroe Trotter,
editor of <em>The Boston Guardian</em>. While there he delivered an
address in Fanueil Hall, the cradle of American liberty, and told the
Negroes of Boston what their brothers in New York had done and were
doing. The result was the linking up of the New York and the Boston
organizations, and Harrison was elected chairman of a national committee
of arrangements to issue a call to every Negro organization in the
country to send delegates to a great race-congress which is to meet in
Washington in September or October and put their grievances before the
country and Congress.</p>
<p>At the New York mass-meeting money was subscribed for the
establishment of a newspaper to be known as The Voice and to serve as
the medium of expression for the new demands and aspirations of the new
Negro. It was made clear that this “New Negro Movement” represented a
breaking away of the Negro masses from the grip of the old-time
leaders—none of whom was represented at the meeting. The audience rose
to their feet with cheers when Harrison was introduced by the chairman.
The most striking passages of his speech were those in which he demanded
that Congress make lynching a Federal crime and take the Negro’s life
under national protection, and declared that since lynching was murder
and a violation of Federal and State laws, it was incumbent upon the
Negroes themselves to maintain the majesty of the law and put down the
law-breakers by organizing all over the South to defend their own lives
whenever their right to live was invaded by mobs which the local
authorities were too weak or unwilling to suppress.</p>
<p>The meeting was also addressed by Mr. J. C. Thomas, Jr., a young
Negro lawyer, who pointed out the weakness and subserviency of the
old-time political leaders and insisted that Negroes stop begging for
charity in the matter of their legal rights and demand justice
instead.</p>
<p>Mr. Marcus Garvey, president of the Jamaica Improvement Association,
was next introduced by Mr. Harrison. He spoke in enthusiastic approval
of the new movement and pledged it his hearty support.</p>
<p>After the Rev. Dr. Cooper, the pastor of Bethel, had addressed the
meeting, the following resolutions were adopted and a petition to
Congress was prepared and circulated. In addition the meeting sent a
telegram to the Jews of Russia, congratulating them upon the acquisition
of full political and civil rights and expressing the hope that the
United States might soon follow the democratic example of Russia.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<h3 id="resolutions-passed-at-the-liberty-league-meeting">Resolutions
Passed at the Liberty League Meeting</h3>
<p>Two thousand Negro-Americans assembled in mass-meeting at Bethel
A.M.E. Church to protest against lynching in the land of liberty, and
disfranchisement in the home of democracy have, after due deliberation,
adopted the following resolutions and make them known to the world at
large in the earnest hope that whenever the world shall be made safe for
democracy our corner of that world will not be forgotten.</p>
<p><em>We believe that this world war will and must result in a larger
measure of democracy for the peoples engaged therein—whatever may be the
secret ambitions of their several rulers.</em></p>
<p><em>We therefore ask, first, that when the war shall be ended and the
council of peace shall meet to secure to every people the right to rule
their own ancestral lands free from the domination of tyrants, domestic
and foreign, the similar rights of the 250,000,000 Negroes of Africa be
conceded. Not to concede them this is to lay the foundation for more
wars in the future and to saddle the new democracies with the burden of
a militarism greater than that under which the world now
groans.</em></p>
<p>Secondly, we, as Negro-Americans who have poured out our blood freely
in every war of the Republic, and upheld her flag with undivided
loyalty, demand that since we have shared to the full measure of manhood
in bearing the burdens of democracy we should also share in the rights
and privileges of that democracy.</p>
<p>And we believe that the present time, when the hearts of ninety
millions of our white fellow-citizens are aflame with the passionate
ardor of democracy which has carried them into the greatest war of the
age with the sole purpose of suppressing autocracy in Europe, is the
best time to appeal to them to give to twelve millions of us the
elementary rights of democracy at home.</p>
<p>For democracy, like charity, begins at home, and we find it hard to
endure without murmur and with the acquiescence of our government the
awful evils of lynching, which is a denial of the right to life; of
segregation, Jim Crowism and peonage, which are a denial of the right to
liberty; and disfranchisement, which is a denial of justice and
democracy.</p>
<p>And since Imperial Russia, formerly the most tyrannous government in
Europe, has been transformed into Republican Russia, whereby millions of
political serfs have been lifted to the level of citizenship rights;
since England is offering the meed of political manhood to the hitherto
oppressed Irish and the down-trodden Hindu; and since these things have
helped to make good the democratic assertions of these countries of the
old world now engaged in war;</p>
<p>Therefore, be it resolved:</p>
<p>That we, the Negro people of the first republic of the New World, ask
all true friends of democracy in this country to help us to win these
same precious rights for ourselves and our children.</p>
<p>That we invite the government’s attention to the great danger which
threatens democracy through the continued violation of the 13th, 14th
and 15th amendments, which is a denial of justice and the existence of
mob-law for Negroes from Florida to New York;</p>
<p>That we intend to protest and to agitate by every legal means until
we win these rights from the hands of our government and induce it to
protect democracy from these dangers, and square the deeds of our nation
with its declarations;</p>
<p>That we create adequate instruments for securing these ends and make
our voice heard and heeded in the councils of our country, and</p>
<p>That copies of these resolutions be forwarded to the Congress of the
United States and to such other public bodies as shall seem proper to
us.</p>

Liberty League’s Petition to the House of Representatives of the United
States, July 4, 1917</h3>
<p>We, the Negro people of the United States, loyal to our country in
every respect, and obedient to her laws, respectfully petition your
honorable body for a redress of the specific grievances and flagrant
violations of your own laws as set forth in this statement. We beg to
call your attention to the discrepancy which exists between the public
profession of the government that we are lavishing our resources of men
and money in this war in order to make the world safe for democracy, and
the just as public performances of lynching-bees, Jim-crowism and
disfranchisement in which our common country abounds.</p>
<p>We should like to believe in our government’s professions of
democracy, but find it hard to do so in the presence of the facts; and
we judge that millions of other people outside of the country will find
it just as hard.</p>
Desirous, therefore, of squaring our country’s profession with her
performance, that she may not appear morally contemptible in the eyes of
friends and foes alike, we, the Negro people of the United States, who
have never been guilty of any disloyalty or treason to our government,
demand that the nation shall justify to the world her assertions of
democracy by setting free the millions of Negroes in the South from
political and civil slavery through the enactment of laws which will
either take the Negroes under the direct protection of the U. S.
Congress by making lynching a Federal crime, or (by legislative mandate)
compelling the several States which now deprive the Negroes of their
right to self-government, to give them the suffrage as Russia has done
for her Jews. W ask his in the name of the American declaration that the
world shall be made safe for democracy and fervently pray that your
honorable body will not go back upon democracy.

<h2 id="chapter-ii.democracy-and-race-friction">CHAPTER II.<BR>DEMOCRACY
AND RACE FRICTION</h2>
<h3 id="the-east-st.-louis-horror">The East St. Louis Horror</h3>
<p>This nation is now at war to make the world “safe for democracy,” but
the Negro’s contention in the court of public opinion is that until this
nation itself is made safe for twelve million of its subjects the Negro,
at least, will refuse to believe in the democratic assertions of the
country. The East St. Louis pogrom gives point to this contention. Here,
on the eve of the celebration of the Nation’s birthday of freedom and
equality, the white people, who are denouncing the Germans as Huns and
barbarians, break loose in an orgy of unprovoked and villainous
barbarism which neither Germans nor any other civilized people have ever
equalled.</p>
<p>How can America hold up its hands in hypocritical horror at foreign
barbarism while the red blood of the Negro is clinging to those hands?
so long as the President and Congress of the United States remain dumb
in the presence of barbarities in their own land which would tip their
tongues with righteous indignation if they had been done in Belgium,
Ireland or Galicia?</p>
<p>And what are the Negroes to do? Are they expected to re-echo with
enthusiasm the patriotic protestations of the boot-licking leaders whose
pockets and positions testify to the power of the white man’s gold? Let
there be no mistake. Whatever the Negroes may be compelled by law to do
and say, the resentment in their hearts will not down. Unbeknown to the
white people of this land a temper is being developed among Negroes with
which the American people will have to reckon.</p>
<p>At the present moment it takes this form: If white men are to kill
unoffending Negroes, Negroes must kill white men in defense of their
lives and property. This is the lesson of the East St. Louis
massacre.</p>
<p>The press reports declare that, “the troops who were on duty during
the most serious disturbances were ordered not to shoot.” The civil and
military authorities are evidently winking at the work of the
mobs—horrible as that was—and the Negroes of the city need not look to
them for protection. They must protect themselves. And even the United
States Supreme Court concedes them this right.</p>
<p>There is, in addition, a method of retaliation which we urge upon
them.</p>
<p>It is one which will hit those white men who have the power to
prevent lawlessness just where they will feel it most, in the place
where they keep their consciences—the pocket-book. Let every Negro in
East St. Louis and the other cities where race rioting occurs draw his
money from the savings-bank and either bank it in the other cities or in
the postal savings bank. The only part of the news reports with which we
are well pleased is that which states that the property loss is already
estimated at a million and a half of dollars.</p>
<p>Another reassuring feature is the one suppressed in most of the news
dispatches. We refer to the evidences that the East St. Louis Negroes
organized themselves during the riots and fought back under some kind of
leadership. We Negroes will never know, perhaps, how many whites were
killed by our enraged brothers in East St. Louis. It isn’t the
news-policy of the white newspapers (whether friendly or unfriendly) to
spread such news broadcast. It might teach Negroes too much. But we will
hope for the best.</p>
<p>The occurrence should serve to enlarge rapidly the membership of The
Liberty League of Negro-Americans which was organized to take practical
steps to help our people all over the land in the protection of their
lives and liberties. —July 4th, 1917.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<h3 id="arms-and-the-man">“Arms and the Man”</h3>
<p>In its editorial on “The East St. Louis Horror” <em>The Voice</em>
said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can America hold up its hands in hypocritical horror at foreign
barbarism while the red blood of the Negro is clinging to those hands?
So long as the President and Congress of the United States remain dumb
in the presence of barbarities in their own land which would tip their
tongues with righteous indignation if they had been done in Belgium,
Ireland or Galicia?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And what are the Negroes to do? Are they expected to re-echo with
enthusiasm the patriotic protestations of the boot-licking leaders whose
pockets and positions testify to the power of the white man’s gold? Let
there be no mistake. Whatever the Negroes may be compelled by law to do
and say, the resentment in their hearts will not down. <em>Unbeknown to
the white people of this land a temper is being developed among Negroes
with which the American people will have to reckon.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>At the present moment it takes this form: If white men are to
kill unoffending Negroes, Negroes must kill white men in defence of
their lives and property. This is the lesson of the East St. Louis
massacre.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To this, the New York <em>Age</em> makes reply in two ways. Its
editor, in an interview given to the <em>Tribune</em>, declares
that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The representative Negro does not approve of radical socialistic
outbursts, such as calling upon the Negroes to defend themselves against
the whites.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And in its editorial of last week it insists that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No man, or woman either, for that matter, is a friend to the race,
who publicly advises a resort to violence to redress the wrongs and
injustices to which members of the race are subjected in various
sections of the country at the present time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Negro race is afflicted with many individuals whose wagging
tongues are apt to lead them into indiscreet utterances that reflect
upon the whole race. … The unruly tongues should not be allowed to
alienate public sympathy from the cause of the oppressed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, although <em>The Voice</em> seeks no quarrel with <em>The
Age</em>, we are forced to dissent from this cringing, obsequious view
which it champions. And we do this on the ground that cringing has gone
out of date, that <em>The Age’s</em> view does not now represent any
influential or important section of Negro opinion. The group which once
held that view went to pieces when Dr. Washington died. The white papers
in their news items of last week gave instance after instance showing
that Negroes not only counselled self-defense, but actually practiced
it. (And <em>The Age</em>, by the way, was the only <em>Negro</em> paper
in New York City which excluded these items from its news columns.) If
the press reports are correct, then <em>The Voice</em> told the simple
truth when it spoke of the new temper which was being developed
“unbeknown to the white people of this land.” And an outsider might
conclude that <em>The Voice</em> was a better friend to the white people
by letting them know this, than The Age was by trying to lie about
it.</p>
<p>But the controversy goes much deeper than the question of candor and
truthfulness. <em>The Age</em> and <em>The Voice</em> join issue on this
double question: Have Negroes a right to defend themselves against
whites? Should they defend themselves? (And this, of course, means
violence.) <em>The Voice</em> answers, “Yes!” <em>The Age</em> answers
“No!” Who is to decide? Let us appeal to the courts. Every law-book and
statute-book, every court in the civilized world and in the United
States agree that every <em>human</em> being has the legal as well as
moral right to kill those who attack and try to kill him. Then the
question for <em>The Age</em> to decide, is whether Negroes are human
beings. To call our view “socialistic” is to call the courts
“socialistic,” and displays an amazing ignorance both of Socialism and
of human nature.</p>
<p>Before we leave this question, it is proper to consider the near and
remote consequences of the radical view. <em>The Age</em> says that
unruly tongues will alienate public sympathy from the oppressed. Good
God! Isn’t it high time to ask of what value is that kind of sympathy
which is ready to be alienated as soon as Negroes cease to be “niggers”
and insist on being men? Is that the sort of sympathy on which <em>The
Age</em> has thrived? Then we will have none of it.</p>
<p>And, as to the remoter consequences: neither we nor <em>The Age</em>
has a lease on the future. We can but prophesy. But intelligent people
reach the unknown via the known, and prophesy the future from the known
past and present. And we do know that no race or group of people past or
present ever won to the status of manhood among men by yielding up that
right which even a singed cat will not yield up—the right to defend
their lives. If <em>The Age</em> knows of any instance to the contrary
in the history of the past seven thousand years, let it mention that
instance. But <em>The Age</em> may ask:</p>
<p>“What will self defense accomplish?” Let us see first what the
absence of self-defense accomplishes. In its news account of the
St. Louis massacre, the <em>Amsterdam News</em> shows that whenever the
white mobs found a group of Negroes organized and armed, <em>they turned
back</em>; while <em>The Age</em> itself had this significant and
pathetic sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since the massacre, which will go down in history alongside the
atrocities committed in Brussels and Rheims, a delegation of Negroes has
held a conference with Governor Lowden at Springfield, <em>but the
outcome of this meeting will not bring back the lives of those who, for
no valid reason, were struck down and murdered in cold blood.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taking the two things together the answer seems clear enough. When
murder is cheap murder is indulged in recklessly; when it is likely to
be costly it is not so readily indulged in. Will <em>The Age</em>
venture to deny this? No? Then we say, let Negroes help to make murder
costly, for by so doing they will aid the officers of the city, state
and nation in instilling respect for law and order into the minds of the
worst and lowest elements of our American cities. And we go further: We
say that it is not alone the brutality of the whites—it is also the
cowardice of Negroes and the lickspittle leadership of the last two
decades which, like <em>The Age</em>, told us to “take it all lying
down”—it is this which has been the main reason for our “bein’ so aisily
lynched,” as Mr. Dooley puts it.</p>
<p>Whatever <em>The Age</em> may say, Negroes will fight back as they
are already fighting back. And they will be more highly regarded—as are
the Irish—because of fighting back.</p>
<p>We are aiming at the white man’s respect—not at his sympathy. We
cannot win that respect by any conspicuous and contemptible cowardice;
the only kind of sympathy which we may win by that is the kind of
sympathy which men feel for a well-kicked dog which cringes while they
kick it.</p>
<p>“Rights are to be won by those who are ready and willing to fight, if
necessary, to have those rights respected.”</p>
<p>Who says this? Theodore Roosevelt. So does President Wilson. So does
the U. S. Government. That is why we went to war with Germany. Our
country always acts upon the best and highest principle and we Negroes
have just begun to see that our country is quite right. Therefore, we
are willing to follow its glorious example. That is all.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<h3 id="the-negro-and-the-labor-unions">The Negro and the Labor
Unions</h3>
<p>There are two kinds of labor unionism; the A.F. of L. kind and the
other kind. So far, the Negro has been taught to think that all unionism
was like the unionism of the American Federation of Labor, and because
of this ignorance, his attitude toward organized labor has been that of
the scab. For this no member of the A.F. of L. can blame the Negro. The
policy of that organization toward the Negro has been damnable. It has
kept him out of work and out of the unions as long as it could; and when
it could no longer do this it has taken him in, tricked him, and
discriminated against him.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the big capitalists who pay low wages (from the
son of Abraham Lincoln in the Pullman Co. to Julius Rosenwald of the
Sears Roebuck Co.) have been rather friendly to the Negro. They have
given their money to help him build Y.M.C.A.’s and schools of a certain
type. They have given him community help in Northern cities and have
expended charity on him— and on the newspapers and parsons who taught
him. Small wonder, then, that the Negro people are anti-union.</p>
<p>Labor unions were created by white working men that they might bring
the pressure of many to bear upon the greedy employer and make him give
higher wages and better living conditions to the laborer. When they, in
turn, become so greedy that they keep out the majority of working
people, by high dues and initiation fees, they no longer represent the
interests of the laboring class. They stand in the way of this class’s
advancement—<em>and they must go</em>. They must leave the way clear for
the 20th century type of unionism which says: “To leave a single worker
out is to leave something for the boss to use against us. Therefore we
must organize in One Big Union of all the working-class.” This is the
type of unionism which organized, in 1911, 18,000 white and 14,000 black
timber workers in Louisiana. This is the I.W.W. type of unionism, and
the employers use their newspapers to make the public believe that it
stands for anarchy, violence, law-breaking and atheism, because they
know that if it succeeds it will break them.</p>
<p>This type of unionism wants Negroes—not because its promoters love
Negroes—but because they realize that they cannot win if any of the
working class is left out; and after winning they cannot go back on them
because they could be used as scabs to break the unions.</p>
<p>The A.F. of L., which claims a part of the responsibility for the
East St. Louis outrage, is playing with fire. The American Negro may
join hands with the American capitalist and scab them out of existence.
And the editor of <em>The Voice</em> calls upon Negroes to do this. We
have stood the American Federation of Labor just about long enough. Join
hands with the capitalists and scab them out of existence—not in the
name of scabbery, but in the name of a real organization of labor. Form
your own unions (the A.C.E. is already in the field) and make a truce
with your capitalist enemy until you get rid of this traitor to the
cause of labor. Offer your labor to capitalism if it will agree to
protect you in your right to labor—and see that it does. Then get rid of
the A.F. of L.</p>
<p>The writer has been a member of a party which stood for the rights of
labor and the principle of Industrial Unionism (the 20th century kind).
He understands the labor conditions of the country and desires to see
the working man win out. But his first duty, here as everywhere, is to
the Negro race. And he refuses to put ahead of his race’s rights a
collection of diddering jackasses which can publicly palliate such
atrocities as that of East St. Louis and publicly assume, as Gompers
did, responsibility for it. Therefore, he issues the advice to the
workers of his race to “can the A.F. of L.” Since the A.F. of L. chooses
to put Race before Class, let us return the compliment.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<h3 id="lynching-its-cause-and-cure">Lynching: Its Cause and Cure</h3>
<p>Last week we had occasion to comment on the resignation of Mr. John
R. Shillady from the secretaryship of the N.A.A.C.P. Mr. Shillady’s
statement accompanying his resignation contains these significant
words:—</p>
<p>“I am less confident than heretofore of the speedy success of the
association’s full program and of the probability of overcoming within a
reasonable period the forces opposed to Negro equality by the means and
methods which are within the association’s power to employ.”</p>
<p>That the N.A.A.C.P. is not likely to affect the lynchings in this
land can be seen with half an eye by any one who will note that Governor
J. A. Burnquist of Minnesota “is also president of the St. Paul branch
of the association and one of the staunch supporters of its work”; that
the Minnesota lynching of last week was one of the most cynically brutal
that has occurred North or South in the last ten years, and that the
association has offered and is offering to give the Governor all the
assistance possible.</p>
<p>In most of the other cases of lynchings it is assumed that all the
officials were in collusion with the forces of violence, or were at any
rate in acquiescence. In the present case, however, the Governor of the
State is himself a high officer of the association. Yet we venture to
prophesy that no more will be done in the case of the Minnesota
lynchings than in the case of lynchings further south.</p>
<p>This leads us to a front face consideration of the problem of
lynching. Why do white men lynch black men in America? We are not
dealing here with the original historical cause; nor even with its
present social application. We are considering merely the efficient
cause. White men lynch black men or any other men because those men’s
lives are unprotected either by the authorities of the commonwealth or
by the victims themselves. White men lynch Negroes in America because
Negroes’ lives are cheap. So long as they so remain, so long will
lynching remain an evil to be talked about, written about, petitioned
against and slobbered over. But not all the slobber, the talk or the
petitions are worth the time it takes to indulge in them, so far as the
saving of a single Negro life is concerned.</p>
<p>What, then, is the cure? The cure follows from the nature of the
cause. Let Negroes determine that their lives shall no longer be cheap;
but that they will exact for them as high a price as any other element
in the community under similar circumstances would exact. Let them see
to it that their lives are protected and defended, if not by the State,
then certainly by themselves. Then we will see the cracker stopping to
take counsel with himself and to think twice before he joins a mob in
whose gruesome holiday sport he himself is likely to furnish one of the
casualties.</p>
“Let Negroes help to make murder costly, for by so doing they will aid
the officers of the city, State and nation in instilling respect for law
and order into the minds of the worst and lowest elements of our
American cities.” The law of every State says explicitly that killing in
defense of one’s own life is strictly proper, legal and justifiable.
Therefore, if Negroes determine to defend themselves from the horrible
outrage of lynching they should have the support of every official and
every citizen who really believes in law and order and is determined to
make the law of the land stand as a living reality among the people that
made it. —July, 1920.

<h2 id="chapter-iii.the-negro-and-the-war">CHAPTER III.<BR>THE NEGRO AND
THE WAR</h2>
<p>[While the war lasted those of us who saw unpalatable truths were
compelled to do one of two things: either tell the truth as we saw it
and go to jail, or camouflage the truth that we had to tell. The present
writer told the truth for the most part, in so far as it related to our
race relations; but, in a few cases camouflage was safer and more
effective. That camouflage, however, was never of that truckling quality
which was accepted by the average American editor to such a nauseating
degree. I was well aware that Woodrow Wilson’s protestations of
democracy were lying protestations, consciously and deliberately
designed to deceive. What, then, was my duty in the face of that fact? I
chose to pretend that Woodrow Wilson meant what he said, because by so
doing I could safely hold up to contempt and ridicule the undemocratic
practices of his administration and the actions of his white countrymen
in regard to the Negro. How this was done is shown in the first two
editorials of the following chapter.]</p>
<h3 id="is-democracy-unpatriotic">Is Democracy Unpatriotic?</h3>
<p>The present administration is all right. But it has its obstacles to
success. As usual some of the worst of these are its injudicious
“friends.” For instance, there are the people who are trying their best
to “queer” us in the eyes of civilized Europe. These silly souls, when
Negroes ask that the principle of “Justice in War Time”: be applied to
Negroes as well as whites, reply, in effect that this should not be;
that Negroes should not want Justice—in war time—and that any such
demand on their part is “disloyalty.” On the contrary, it is the fullest
loyalty to the letter and spirit of the President’s war-aims. To say
that it isn’t is to presume to accuse the President of having war-aims
other than those which he has set forth in the face of Europe.</p>
<p>Besides, no one can deny that freedom from lynching and
disfranchisement and the ending of discrimination—by the Red Cross for
instance—will strengthen the hand of the administration right now by
strengthening its hold on the hearts of the Negro masses and will make
all Negroes—soldiers as well as civilians—more competent to give
effective aid in winning the war.</p>
<p>Let us assume that we consent to being lynched—“during the war”—and
submit tamely and with commendable weakness to being Jim-crowed and
disfranchised. Very well. Will not that be the proof of our spirit and
of its quality? Of course. And what you <em>call</em> that spirit won’t
alter its quality, will it? Now, ask all the peoples of all the world
what they call a people who smilingly consent to their own degradation
and destruction. They call such a people cowards—because they
<em>are</em> cowards. In America we call such people “niggers.”</p>
<p>Is anyone unpatriotic enough to pretend that “cowards” can lick
“Huns”? No, this great world-task can be accomplished only by
men—English men, French men, Italian men, American men. Our country
needs men now more than it ever did before. And those who multiply its
reserve of men are adding to its strength. That is why the true patriots
who really love America and want it to win the war are asking America to
change its Negroes from “niggers” into men. Surely this is a patriotic
request; and any one who says that it isn’t must be prepared to maintain
that lynching, Jim-crow and disfranchisement are consistent with
patriotism and ought to be preserved. Reading the President’s
proclamations in reverent spirit, we deny both of these monstrous
conclusions; and we believe that we have on our side the President of
America, the world’s foremost champion of democracy who defined it as
“the right of all those who submit to authority to have a VOICE in their
own government”—whether it be in Germany or in Georgia. And we believe
that the splendid spirit of our common country, which has buckled on its
sword in support of “democracy” will support us in this reasonable
contention. —July, 1918.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<h3 id="why-is-the-red-cross">Why Is the Red Cross?</h3>
<p>The Red Cross, or Geneva Association, was the product of a Swiss
infidel. He saw how cruel to man were those who loved God most—the
Christians—and, out of his large humanity and loving kindness, he
evolved an organization which should bring the charity of service to
lessen the lurid horrors of Christian battlefields.</p>
<p>A love that rose above the love of country—the love of human kind:
this was the proud principle of the Red Cross. Its nurses and its
surgeons, stretcher-bearers and assistants were supposed to bring relief
to those who were in pain, regardless of whether they were “friends” or
“enemies.” Discrimination was a word which did not exist for them: and
it is not supposed to exist now even as against the wounded German
aviator who has bombed a Red Cross hospital.</p>
<p>But, alack and alas! The splendid spirit of the Swiss infidel is
seemingly too high for Christian race-prejudice to reach. Where he would
not discriminate even against enemies, the American branch of his
international society is discriminating against most loyal friends and
willing helpers—when they are Negroes. Up to date the American Red Cross
Society, which receives government aid and co-operation to help win the
war, cannot cite the name of a single Negro woman as a nurse. True, it
says that it has “enrolled” some. This we refuse to believe. But even if
that were true, a nurse “enrolled” cannot save the life of any of our
soldiers in France.</p>
<p>The Red Cross says that it wants to win the war. What war? A white
people’s war, or America’s and the world’s? It this were a white
people’s war, as some seem to think, colored troops from Senegal, India,
Egypt, America and the West Indies would have been kept out of it. But
they were not, and we are driven to conclude that this is a world war.
Then why doesn’t the American Red Cross meet it in the spirit of the
President—of world democracy? The cry goes up for nurses to save the
lives of soldiers; yet here are thousands of Negro nurses whom the Red
Cross won’t accept. They must want to give Europe a “rotten” opinion of
American democracy. For we may be sure that these things are known in
Europe—even as our lynchings are. And anyone who would give Europe a
“rotten” opinion of America at this time is no friend of America.</p>
<p>The American Red Cross must be compelled to do America’s work in the
spirit in which America has entered the war. There need be no biting of
tongues: it must be compelled to forego Race Prejudice. If the
N.A.A.C.P. were truly what it pretends instead of a National Association
for the Advancement of Certain People, it would put its high-class
lawyers on the job and bring the case into the United States courts. It
would charge the American Red Cross with disloyalty to the war-aims of
America. And if it does not (in spite of the money which it got from the
“silent” protest parade and other moneys and legal talent at its
disposal) then it will merit the name which one of its own members gave
it—the National Association for the Acceptance of Color Proscription.
Get busy, “friends of the colored people”! For we are not disposed to
regard the camouflage of those who want nurses but do not want Negro
nurses in any other light than that of Bret Harte’s Truthful James:—</p>

<h3 id="a-hint-of-our-reward">A Hint of Our Reward</h3>
<p>The wisdom of our contemporary ancestors, having decided that “We
Negroes must make every sacrifice to help win the war and lay aside our
just demands for the present that we may win a shining place on the
pages of history,” it must be cold comfort to learn that the first
after-the-war schoolbook of American history is out, that it is written
by Reuben Gold Thwaites and Calvin Noyes Kendall, that it devotes
thirty-one pages to the war and America’s part in the war, and that
<em>not one word is said of the Negro’s part therein.</em></p>
<p>Of course, sensible men should feel no surprise at this, for they
will realize how little the part played by the Negro in the Civil War is
known by the millions of white school children who read the school
histories. Yet, if there is a spark of manhood left in the bosoms of our
“white men’s niggers” who sold us out during the war they must feel
pained and humiliated when the flood of after-the-war school histories,
of which this is the first, quietly sink the Negro’s contributions (as
chronicled by Mr. Emmett Scott and others) into the back waters of
forgetfulness.</p>
<p>The times change, but we don’t change with them.</p>

<h3 id="the-negro-at-the-peace-congress">The Negro at the Peace
Congress</h3>
<p>Now that they have helped to win the war against Germany, the Negro
people in these United States feel the absurdity of the situation in
which they find themselves. They have given lavishly of their blood and
treasure. They have sent their young men overseas as soldiers, and were
willing to send their young women overseas as nurses; but the innate
race-prejudice of the American Red Cross prevented them. They have
contributed millions of dollars to the funds of this same Red Cross and
scores of millions to the four Liberty Loans; and they have done all
this to help make the world “safe for democracy” even while in sixteen
States of the south in which nine-tenths of them reside, they have no
voice in their own government. Naturally they expect that something will
have to be done to remove their civil and other disabilities. This
expectation of theirs is a just and reasonable one. But— —</p>
<p>Now that the world is getting ready for the Peace Congress which is
expected to settle <em>the questions about which the war was fought</em>
our Negroes want to know if the Peace Congress will settle such
questions as those of lynching, disfranchisement and segregation. IT
WILL NOT! And why? Simply because the war was not fought over these
questions. Even a fool can see that. Lynching, disfranchisement and
Jim-crowing in America are questions of American domestic policy and can
be regulated only by American law-making and administrative bodies. Even
a fool should be able to see this. And, since it was only by the
military aid of the United States that the Allies were able to win the
war, why should our people be stupid enough to think that the allied
nations will aim a slap at the face of the United States (even if such
things were customary) by attempting to interfere in her domestic
arrangements and institutions?</p>
<p>We learn that various bodies of Negroes, who do not seem to
understand the modern system of political government under which they
live, are seeking to get money from the unsuspecting masses of our
people “for the purpose of sending delegates to the Peace Congress.” The
project is sublimely silly. In the first place, the Peace Congress is
not open to anybody who chooses to be sent. A peep into any handbook of
modern history would show that Peace Congresses are made up only of
delegates chosen by the heads of the governments of the countries which
have been at war, and never by civic, propaganda, or other bodies within
those nations. Only the President of the United States has power to
designate the American delegates to the Peace Congress.</p>
<p>Of course, if any body of people wish to send a visitor to Versailles
or Paris <em>at their expense</em>, the government of the United States
has nothing to do with that and would not prevent it. But such visitor,
lacking credentials from the President, could not get within a block of
the Peace Congress. They can (if they read French) get from the papers
published in the city where the Congress meets so much of the
proceedings as the Congress may choose to give to the press. But that is
all; and for that it is not necessary to go to France. Just send to
France for copies of <em>Le Temps</em> or <em>Le Matin</em> and prevent
a useless waste of the money of poor people who can ill afford it in any
case.</p>
<p>“But,” we are told, “such person or persons can make propaganda (in
France) which will force the Peace Congress to consider American
lynching, disfranchisement and segregation,” Passing over the argument
that such person or persons would have to be able to write French
fluently, we wish to point out that the public sentiment of even one
French city takes more than a month to work up; that the sentiment of
one French city can have but slight weight with the Congress, and that,
if it could rise to the height of embarrassing them, the French
authorities would sternly put it down and banish the troublesome
persons. Karl Marx, Prince Kropotkin, Malatesta and Lenine are cases in
point as showing what France has done under less provoking
circumstances.</p>
<p>Let us not try to play the part of silly fools. Lynching,
disfranchisement and segregation are evils HERE; and the place in which
we must fight them is HERE. If foolish would-be leaders have no plan to
lay before our people for the fighting HERE, in God’s name, let them say
so, and stand out of the way! Let us gird up our loins for the stern
tasks which lie before us HERE and address ourselves to them with
courage and intelligence.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<h3 id="africa-and-the-peace">Africa and the Peace</h3>
<p>“This war, disguise it how we may, is really being fought over
African questions.” So said Sir Harry Johnston, one of the foremost
authorities on Africa, in the London Sphere in June, 1917. We wonder if
the Negroes of the Western world quite realize what this means. Wars are
not fought for ideals but for lands whose populations can be put to
work, for resources that can be minted into millions, for trade that can
be made to enrich the privileged few. When King Leopold of Belgium and
Thomas Fortune Ryan of New York joined hands to exploit the wealth of
the Congo they did it with oiled phrases on their lips. They called that
land of horrors and of shame “The Congo FREE State!”</p>
<p>And, so, when Nations go to war, they never openly declare what they
WANT. They must camouflage their sordid greed behind some sounding
phrase like “freedom of the seas,” “self-determination,” “liberty” or
“democracy.” But only the ignorant millions ever think that those are
the real objects of their bloody rivalries. When the war is over, the
mask is dropped, and then they seek “how best to scramble at the
shearers’ feast.” It is then that they disclose their real war aims.</p>
<p>One of the most striking cases in point is the present peace
congress. Already President Wilson has had to go to look after democracy
himself. Already responsible heads of the Allied governments are making
it known that “freedom of the seas” means a benevolent naval despotism
maintained by them, and that “democracy” means simply the transfer of
Germany’s African lands to England and the others. Africa at the peace
table constitutes the real stakes which the winners will rake in. We may
read in headlines the startling item “Negroes Ask For German Colonies,”
but Negroes of sense should not be deluded. They will not get them
because they have no battleships, no guns, no force, military or
financial. They are not a Power.</p>
<p>Despite the pious piffle of nice old gentlemen like Professor Kelly
Miller, the King-word of modern nations is POWER. It is only Sunday
school “kids” and people of child-races who take seriously such fables
as that in the “Band of Hope Review” when we were children that “the
secret of England’s greatness is the Bible.” The secret of England’s
greatness (as well as of any other great nation’s) is not bibles but
bayonets—bayonets, business and brains. As long as the white nations
have a preponderance of these, so long will they rule. Ask Japan: she
knows. And as long as the lands of Africa can yield billions of
business, so long will white brains use bayonets to keep them—as the
British government did last year in Nigeria.</p>
<p><em>Africa is turning over in her sleep, and this agitation now going
on among American Negroes for the liberation of Africa is a healthy sign
of her restlessness. But it is no more than that.</em> Africa’s hands
are tied, and, so tied, she will be thrown upon the peace table. Let us
study how to unloose her bonds later. Instead of futile expectations
from the doubtful generosity of white land-grabbers, let us American
Negroes go to Africa, live among the natives and LEARN WHAT THEY HAVE TO
TEACH US (for they have much to teach us). Let us go there—not in the
coastlands,—but in the interior, in Nigeria and Nyassaland; let us study
engineering and physics, chemistry and commerce, agriculture and
industry; let us learn more of nitrates, of copper, rubber and
electricity; so will we know why Belgium, France, England and Germany
want to be in Africa. Let us begin by studying the scientific works of
the African explorers and stop reading and believing the silly slush
which ignorant missionaries put into our heads about the alleged
degradation of our people in Africa. Let us learn to know Africa and
Africans so well that every educated Negro will be able at a glance to
put his hand on the map of Africa and tell where to find the Jolofs,
Ekois, Mandingoes, Yorubas, Bechuanas or Basutos and can tell something
of their marriage customs, their property laws, their agriculture and
systems of worship. For, not until we can do this will it be seemly for
us to pretend to be anxious about their political welfare.</p>
<p>Indeed, it would be well now for us to establish friendly relations
and correspondence with our brothers at home. For we don’t know enough
about them to be able to do them any good at THIS peace congress (even
if we were graciously granted seats there); but fifty years from now—WHO
KNOWS?</p>
<hr class="tb">
<h3 id="they-shall-not-pass">“They Shall Not Pass!”</h3>
<p>When heroic France was holding the Kaiser’s legions at bay her
inflexible resolution found expression in the phrase, “Ils ne passeront
pas!”—they shall not pass! The white statesmen who run our government in
Washington seem to have adopted the poilu’s watchword in a less worthy
cause. The seventy-odd Negro “delegates” to the Peace Congress who have
got themselves “elected” at mass-meetings and concerts for the purpose
of going to France are not going—unless they can walk, swim, or fly. For
the government will not issue passports for them.</p>
<p>Of course, the government is not telling them so in plain English.
That wouldn’t be like our government. It merely makes them wait while
their money melts away. Day after day and week after week, they wearily
wend their way to the official Circumlocution Office where they receive
a reply considered sufficient for their child-minds: “Not yet.”</p>
<p>It is many weeks since Madam Walker, Mr. Trotter, Judge Harrison and
other lesser lights were elected, but “They shall not pass!” says the
government with the backing of Emmett Scott. THE VOICE holds no brief
for these people: in fact it has taken the trouble to tell them more
than once how silly their project was. But it is not out of order to
inquire why the government will not let them go, and to find an answer
to that question.</p>
<p>The government will not let them go to France, because the
government’s conscience is not clear. And the government ordered that
ludicrous lackey, Mr. R. R. Moton, to go—for the same reason. In fact,
the creation of sinecures for Mr. Scott and the other barnacles is due
largely to an uneasy conscience. How would it look to have Negroes
telling all Europe that the land which is to make the world “safe for
democracy” is rotten with race-prejudice; Jim-crows Negro officers on
ships coming over from France and on trains run under government
control; condones lynching by silent acquiescence and refuses to let its
Negro heroes vote as citizens in that part of the country in which
nine-tenths of them live. This wouldn’t do at all.</p>
<p>Therefore: They shall not pass! And if, finally, the government,
nettled by such criticisms, should lift the ban when the Peace Congress
is practically over, the Negroes of America may be sure that those
permitted to go will be carefully hand-picked.</p>
<p>But what is the matter with America as a land for pioneer work in
planting democracy? Are these Negro <em>emigrés</em> afraid to face the
white men here in the Republican Party or any other and raise Hades
until the Constitution is enforced? Is cowardice the real reason for
their running to France to uncork their mouths? It looks very much like
it. Ladies and gentlemen: don’t run. The fight is here, and here you
will be compelled to face it, or report to us the reason why.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<h3 id="a-cure-for-the-ku-klux">A Cure for the Ku-Klux</h3>
<p>It was in the city of Pulaski in Giles County, Tennessee, that the
original Ku-Klux Klan was organized in the latter part of 1865. The war
had hardly been declared officially at an end when the cowardly
“crackers” who couldn’t lick the Yankees began organizing to take it out
of the Negroes. They passed laws declaring that any black man who
couldn’t show three hundred dollars should be declared a vagrant; that
every vagrant should be put to work in the chain-gang on the public
works of their cities; that three Negroes should not gather together
unless a white man was with them, and other such methods were used as
were found necessary to maintain “white supremacy.” When the national
Congress met in December, 1865, it looked upon these light diversions
with an unfriendly eye and, noting that nothing short of the
re-enslavement of the Negroes would satisfy the “crackers,” it kept them
out of Congress until they would agree to do better. Finding that they
were stiff-necked, Congress passed the 14th and 15th amendments and put
the “cracker” states under military rule until they accepted the
amendments. The result was that the Negro got the ballot as a protection
from “the people who know him best.”</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, the Ku-Klux after rampaging around under the
leadership of that traitor, General Nathaniel B. Forrest, was put
down-for good, as it was thought. Today, after the Negro has been
stripped of the ballot’s protection by the connivance of white
Republicans in Washington and white Democrats at the South, the Ku-Klux
dares to raise its ugly head in its ancestral state of Tennessee. This
time they want to increase that fine brand of democracy which every
coward editor knows that Negroes were getting when they were bidding
them to be patriotic. The Ku-Klux means to shoot them into submission
and torture them into terror before they get to showing their wounds and
asking for the ballot as a recompense.</p>
<p>In this crisis what have the Negro “leaders” got to say on their
people’s behalf? Where is Emmett Scott? Where are Mr. Moton and Dr. Du
Bois? What will the N.A.A.C.P. do besides writing frantic letters? We
fear that they can never rise above the level of appeals. But suppose
the common Negro in Tennessee decides to take a hand in the game?
Suppose he lets it be known that for the life of every Negro soldier or
civilian, two “crackers” will die? Suppose he lets them know that it
will be as costly to kill Negroes as it would be to kill real people?
Then indeed the Ku-Klux would be met upon its own ground. And why
not?</p>
<p>All our laws, even in Tennessee, declare that lynching and
white-capping are crimes against the person. All our laws declare that
people singly or in groups have the right to kill in defense of their
lives. And if the Ku-Klux prevents the officers of the law from
enforcing that law, then it is up to Negroes to help the officers by
enforcing the law on their own account. Why shouldn’t they do it? Lead
and steel, fire and poison are just as potent against “crackers” as they
were against Germans, and democracy is as well worth fighting for in
Tennessee as ever it was on the plains of France. Not until the Negroes
of the south recognize this truth will anybody else recognize it for
them.</p>

POLITICS.</h2>
<h3 id="the-new-politics-for-the-new-negro">The New Politics for the New
Negro</h3>
<p>The world of the future will look upon the world of today as an
essentially new turning point in the path of human progress. All over
the world the spirit of democratic striving is making itself felt. The
new issues have brought forth new ideas of freedom, politics, industry
and society at large. The new Negro living in this new world is just as
responsive to these new impulses as other people are.</p>
<p>In the “good old days” it was quite easy to tell the Negro to follow
in the footsteps of those who had gone before. The mere mention of the
name Lincoln or the Republican party was sufficient to secure his
allegiance to that party which had seen him stripped of all political
power and of civil rights without protest—effective or otherwise.</p>
<p>Things are different now. The new Negro is demanding elective
representation in Baltimore, Chicago and other places. He is demanding
it in New York. The pith of the present occasion is, that he is no
longer begging or asking. He is demanding as a right that which he is in
position to enforce.</p>
<p>In the presence of this new demand the old political leaders are
bewildered, and afraid; for the old idea of Negro leadership by virtue
of the white man’s selection has collapsed. The new Negro leader must be
chosen by his fellows—by those whose strivings he is supposed to
represent.</p>
<p>Any man today who aspires to lead the Negro race must set squarely
before his face the idea of “Race First” Just as the white men of these
and other lands are white men before they are Christians, Anglo-Saxons
or Republicans; so the Negroes of this and other lands are intent upon
being Negroes before they are Christians, Englishmen, or
Republicans.</p>
<p>Sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Charity begins at home,
and our first duty is to ourselves. It is not what we wish but what we
must, that we are concerned with. The world, as it ought to be, is still
for us, as for others, the world that does not exist. The world as it
is, is the real world, and it is to that real world that we address
ourselves. Striving to be men, and finding no effective aid in
government or in politics, the Negro of the Western world must follow
the path of the Swadesha movement of India and the Sinn Fein movement of
Ireland. The meaning of both these terms is “ourselves first.” This is
the mental background of the new politics of the New Negro, and we
commend it to the consideration of all the political parties. For it is
upon this background that we will predicate such policies as shall seem
to us necessary and desirable.</p>
<p>In the British Parliament the Irish Home Rule party clubbed its full
strength and devoted itself so exclusively to the cause of Free Ireland
that it virtually dictated for a time the policies of Liberals and
Conservatives alike. The new Negro race in America will not achieve
political self-respect until it is in a positon to organize itself as
politically independent party and follow the example of the Irish Home
Rulers. This is what will happen in American politics. —September,
1917.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-drift-in-politics">The Drift in Politics</h3>
<p>The Negroes of America—those of them who think—are suspicious of
everything that comes from the white people of America. They have seen
that every movement for the extension of democracy here has broken down
as soon as it reached the color line. Political democracy declared that
“all men are created equal,” meant only all white men; the Christian
church found that the brotherhood of man did not include God’s bastard
children; the public school system proclaimed that the school house was
the backbone of democracy—“for white people only,” and the civil service
says that Negroes must keep their place—at the bottom. So that they can
hardly be blamed for looking askance at any new gospel of freedom.
Freedom to them has been like one of</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">
“those juggling fiends
</div>
<div class="verse">
That palter with us in a double sense;
</div>
<div class="verse">
That keep the word of promise to our ear,
</div>
<div class="verse">
And break it to our hope.”
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this connection, some explanation of the former political
solidarity of those Negroes who were voters may be of service. Up to six
years ago the one great obstacle to the political progress of the
colored people was their sheep-like allegiance to the Republican party.
They were taught to believe that God had raised up a peculiar race of
men called Republicans who had loved the slaves so tenderly that they
had taken guns in their hands and rushed on the ranks of the southern
slaveholders to free the slaves; that this race of men was still in
existence, marching under the banner of the Republican party and showing
their great love for Negroes by appointing from six to sixteen
near-Negroes to soft political snaps. Today that great political
superstition is falling to pieces before the advance of intelligence
among Negroes. They begin to realize that they were sold out by the
Republican party in 1876; that in the last twenty-five years lynchings
have increased, disfranchisement has spread all over the South and
“Jim-crow” cars run even into the national capitol—with the continuing
consent of a Republican Congress, a Republican Supreme Court and
Republican President.</p>
<p>Ever since the Brownsville affair, but more clearly since Taft
declared and put in force the policy of pushing out the few near-Negro
officeholders, the rank and file have come to see that the Republican
party is a great big sham. Many went over to the Democratic party
because, as the <em>Amsterdam News</em> puts it, “They had nowhere else
to go.” Twenty years ago the colored men who joined that party were
ostracized as scalawags and crooks. But today, the defection to the
Democrats of such men as Bishop Walters, Wood, Morton, Carr and
Langston—whose uncle was a colored Republican Congressman from
Virginia—has made the colored democracy respectable and given quite a
tone to political heterdoxy.</p>
<p>All this loosens the bonds of their allegiance and breaks the bigotry
of the last forty years. But of this change in their political
view-point the white world knows nothing. The two leading Negro
newspapers are subsidized by the same political pirates who own the
title-deeds to the handful of hirelings holding office in the name of
the Negro race. One of these papers is an organ of Mr. Washington, the
other pretends to be independent—that is, it must be bought on the
installment plan, and both of them are in New York. Despite this
“conspiracy of silence” the Negroes are waking up, are beginning to
think for themselves, to look with more favor on “new doctrines.” <a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Today the politician who wants the support of the Negro voter will
have to give something more than piecrust promises. The old professional
“friend to the colored people” must have something more solid than the
name of Lincoln and party appointments.</p>
<p>We demand what the Irish and the Jewish voter get: nominations on the
party’s ticket in our own districts. And if we don’t get this we will
smash the party that refuses to give it.</p>
<p>For we are not Republicans, Democrats or Socialists any longer. We
are Negroes first. And we are no longer begging for sops. We demand, not
“recognition,” but representation, and we are out to throw our votes to
any party which gives us this, and withhold them from any party which
refuses to give it. No longer will we follow any leader whose job the
party controls. For we know that no leader so controlled can oppose such
party in our interests beyond a given point.</p>
<p>That is why so much interest attaches to the mass-meeting to be held
at Palace Casino on the 29th where the Citizens’ Committee will make its
report to the Negro voters of Harlem and tell them how it was “turned
down” by the local representatives of the Republican party when it
begged the boon of elective representation. All such rebuffs will make
for manhood-if we are men and will drive us to play in American politics
the same role which the Irish party played in British politics. That is
the new trend in Negro politics, and we must not let any party forget
it. —1917.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-negro-for-president">A Negro for President</h3>
<p>For many years the Negro has been the football of American politics.
Kicked from pillar to post, he goes begging, hat in hand, from a
Republican convention to a Democratic one. Always is he asking some one
else to do something for him. Always is he begging, pleading, demanding
or threatening. In all these cases his dependence is on the good will,
sense of justice or gratitude of the other fellow. And in none of these
cases is the political reaction of the other fellow within the control
of the Negro.</p>
<p>But a change for the better is approaching. Four years ago, the
present writer was propounding in lectures, indoors and outdoors, the
thesis that the Negro people of America would never amount to anything
much politically until they should see fit to imitate the Irish of
Britain and to organize themselves into a political party of their own
whose leaders, on the basis of this large collective vote, could “hold
up” Republicans, Democrats, Socialists or any other political group of
American whites. As in many other cases, we have lived to see time ripen
the fruits of our own thought for some one else to pluck. Here is the
editor of the <em>Challenge</em> making a campaign along these very
lines. His version of the idea takes the form of advocating the
nomination of a Negro for the Presidency of the United States. In this
form we haven’t the slightest doubt that this idea will meet with a
great deal of ridicule and contempt. Nevertheless, we venture to
prophesy that, whether in the hands of Mr. Bridges or another, it will
come to be ultimately accepted as one of the finest contributions to
Negro statesmanship.</p>
<p>No one pretends, of course, that the votes of Negroes can elect a
Negro to the high office of President of the United States. Nor would
any one expect that the votes of white people will be forthcoming to
assist them in such a project. The only way in which a Negro could be
elected President of the United States would be by virtue of the voters
not knowing that the particular candidate was of Negro ancestry. This,
we believe, has already happened within the memory of living men. But,
the essential intent of this new plan is to furnish a focussing-point
around which the ballots of the Negro voters may be concentrated for the
realization of racial demands for justice and equality of opportunity
and treatment. It would be carrying “Race First” with a vengeance into
the arena of domestic politics. It would take the Negro voter out of the
ranks of the Republican, Democratic and Socialist parties and would
enable their leaders to trade the votes of their followers, openly and
above-board, for those things for which masses of men largely exchange
their votes.</p>
<p>Mr. Bridges will find that the idea of a Negro candidate for
President presupposes the creation of a purely Negro party and upon that
prerequisite he will find himself compelled to concentrate. Doubtless,
most of the political wise-acres of the Negro race will argue that the
idea is impossible because it antagonizes the white politicians of the
various parties. They will close their eyes to the fact that politics
implies antagonism and a conflict of interest. They will fail to see
that the only things which count with politicians are votes, and that,
just as one white man will cheerfully cut another white man’s throat to
get the dollars which a black man has, so will one white politician or
party cut another one’s throat politically to get the votes which black
men may cast at the polls. But these considerations will finally carry
the day. Let there be no mistake. The Negro will never be accepted by
the white American democracy except in so far as he can by the use of
force, financial, political or other, win, seize or maintain in the
teeth of opposition that position which he finds necessary to his own
security and salvation. And we Negroes may as well make up our minds now
that we can’t depend upon the good-will of white men in anything or at
any point where our interests and theirs conflict. Disguise it as we
may, in business, politics, education or other departments of life, we
as Negroes are compelled to fight for what we want to win from the white
world.</p>
<p>It is easy enough for those colored men whose psychology is shaped by
their white inheritance to argue the ethics of compromise and
inter-racial co-operation. But we whose brains are still unbastardized
must face the frank realities of this situation of racial conflict and
competition. Wherefore, it is well that we marshal our forces to
withstand and make head against the constant racial pressure. Action and
reaction are equal and opposite. Where there is but slight pressure a
slight resistance will suffice. But where, as in our case, that pressure
is grinding and pitiless, the resistance that would re-establish equal
conditions of freedom must of necessity be intense and radical. And it
is this philosophy which must furnish the motive for such a new and
radical departure as is implied in the joint idea of a Negro party in
American politics and a Negro candidate for the Presidency of these
United States. —June, 1920.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="when-the-tail-wags-the-dog">When the Tail Wags the Dog</h3>
<p>Politically, these United States may be roughly divided into two
sections, so far as the Negroes are concerned. In the North the Negro
population has the vote. In the South it hasn’t. This was not always
so.</p>
<p>There was a time when the Negro voters of the South sent in to
Congress a thin but steady stream of black men who represented their
political interests directly. Due to the misadventures of the
reconstruction period, this stream was shut off until at the beginning
of this century George White, of North Carolina, was the sole and last
representative of the black man with a ballot in the South.</p>
<p>This result was due largely to the characteristic stupidity of the
Negro voter. He was a Republican, he was. He would do anything with his
ballot for Abraham Lincoln—who was dead—but not a thing for himself and
his family, who were all alive and kicking. For this the Republican
party loved him so much that it permitted the Democrats to disfranchise
him while it controlled Congress and the courts, the army and navy, and
all the machinery of law-enforcement in the United States. With its
continuing consent, Jim-crowism, disfranchisement, segregation and
lynching spread abroad over the land. The end of it all was the
reduction of the Negro in the South to the position of a political serf,
an industrial peon and a social outcast.</p>
<p>Recently there has been developed in the souls of black folk a new
manhood dedicated to the proposition that, if all Americans are equal in
the matter of baring their breasts to foreign bayonets, then all
Americans must, by their own efforts, be made equal in balloting for
Presidents and other officers of the government. This principle is
compelling the Republican party in certain localities to consider the
necessity of nominating Negroes on its local electoral tickets. Yet the
old attitude of that party on the political rights of Negroes remains
substantially the same.</p>
<p>Here, for instance, is the Chicago convention, at which the Negro
delegates were lined up to do their duty by the party. Of course, these
delegates had to deal collectively with the white leaders. This was to
their mutual advantage. But the odd feature of the entire affair was
this, that, <em>Whereas the Negro people in the South are not free to
cast their votes, it was precisely from these voteless areas that the
national Republican leaders selected the political spokesmen for the
voting Negroes of the North.</em> Men who will not vote at the coming
election and men who, like Roscoe Simmons, never cast a vote in their
lives were the accredited representatives in whose hands lay the destiny
of a million Negro voters.</p>
<p>But there need be no fear that this insult will annoy the black
brother in the Republican ranks. A Negro Republican generally runs the
rhinoceros and the elephant a close third. In plain English, the average
Negro Republican is too stupid to see and too meek to mind. Then, too,
here is Fate’s retribution for the black man in the North who has never
cared enough to fight (the Republican party) for the political freedom
of his brother in the South, but left him to rot under poll-tax laws and
grandfather clauses. The Northern white Democrats, for letting their
Southern brethren run riot through the Constitution, must pay the
penalty of being led into the ditch by the most ignorant, stupid and
vicious portion of their party. Even so, the Northern Negro Republican,
for letting his Southern brother remain a political ragamuffin, must now
stomach the insult of this same ragamuffin dictating the destiny of the
freer Negroes of the North. In both cases the tail doth wag the dog
because of “the solid South.” Surely, “the judgments of the Lord are
true and righteous altogether!” —July, 1920.</p>

<h3 id="the-grand-old-party">The Grand Old Party</h3>
<p>In the early days of 1861, when the Southern Senators and
Representatives were relinquishing their seats in the United States
Congress and hurling cartels of defiant explanation broadcast, the
Republican party in Congress, under the leadership of Charles Francis
Adams of Massachusetts, organized a joint committee made up of thirteen
members of the Senate and thirty-three members of the House to make
overtures to the seceding Southerners. The result of this friendly
gesture was a proposed thirteenth amendment, which, if the Southerners
had not been so obstinate, would have bridged the chasm. For this
amendment proposed to make the slavery of the black man in America
eternal and inescapable. It provided that no amendment to the
Constitution, or any other proposition affecting slavery in any way,
could ever be legally presented upon the floor of Congress unless its
mover had secured the previous consent of <em>every Senator and
Representative from the slave-holding States</em>. It put teeth into the
Fugitive Slave Law and absolutely gave the Negro over into the keeping
of his oppressors.</p>
<p>Most Negro Americans (and white ones, too) think it fashionable to
maintain the most fervid faith and deepest ignorance about points in
their national history of which they should be informed. We therefore
submit that these facts are open and notorious to those who know
American history. The record will be found slimly and shame-facedly
given in McPherson’s “History of the Rebellion”; at indignant length in
Blaine’s “Twenty Years of Congress” and Horace Greeley’s “The Great
American Conflict.” The document can be examined in Professor
Macdonald’s “Select Documents of United States History.” These works are
to be found in every public library, and we refer to them here because
there are “intellectual” Negroes today who are striving secretly, when
they dare not do so openly, to perpetuate the bonds of serfdom which
bind the Negro Americans to the Republican party. This bond of serfdom,
this debt of gratitude, is supposed to hinge on the love which Abraham
Lincoln and his party are supposed to have borne towards the Negro; and
the object of this appeal to the historical record is to show that that
record demonstrates that if the Negro owes any debt to the Republican
party it is a debt of execration and of punishment rather than one of
gratitude.</p>
<p>It is an astounding fact that in his First Inaugural Address Abraham
Lincoln gave his explicit approval to the substance of the Crittenden
resolutions which the joint committee referred to above had collectively
taken over. This demonstrates that the Republican party at the very
beginning of its contact with the Negro was willing to sell the Negro,
bound hand and foot, for the substance of its own political control.
This Thirteenth Amendment was adopted by six or eight Northern States,
including Pennsylvania and Illinois; and if Fort Sumter had not been
fired upon it would have become by State action the law of the land.</p>
<p>The Republican party did not fight for the freedom of the Negro, but
for the maintenance of its own grip on the government which the election
of Abraham Lincoln had secured. If any one wants to know for what the
Republican party fought he will find it in such facts as this: That
thousands of square miles of the people’s property were given away to
Wall Street magnates who had corrupted the Legislature in their effort
to build railroads on the government’s money. The sordid story is given
in “Forty Years in Wall Street,” by the banker, Henry Clews, and others
who took part in this raid upon the resources of a great but stupid
people.</p>
<p>But the Civil War phase of the Republican party’s treason to the
Negro is not the only outstanding one, as was shown by the late General
Tremaine in his “Sectionalism Unmasked.” Not only was General Grant
elected in 1868 by the newly created Negro vote, as the official records
prove, but his re-election in 1872 was effected by the same means. So
was the election of Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876. Yet when the election
of Hayes had been taken before the overwhelmingly Republican Congress
this shameless party made a deal whereby, in order to pacify the white
“crackers” of the South, the Negro was given over into the hands of the
triumphant Ku-Klux; the soldiers who protected their access to the
ballot box in the worst southern states were withdrawn, while the
“crackers” agreed as the price of this favor to withdraw their
opposition to the election of Hayes. For this there exists ample proof
which will be presented upon the challenge of any politician or editor.
As a Republican Senator from New England shamelessly said, it was a
matter of “Root, hog, or die” for the helpless Negro whose ballots had
buttressed the Republican party’s temple of graft and corruption. So was
reconstruction settled against the Negro by the aid and abetting of the
Republican party.</p>
<p>And since that time lynching, disfranchisement and segregation have
grown with the Republican party in continuous control of the government
from 1861 to 1920—with the exception of eight years of Woodrow Wilson
and eight years of Grover Cleveland. With their continuing consent the
South has been made solid, so that at every Republican convention
delegates who do not represent a voting constituency but a grafting
collection of white postmasters and their Negro lackeys can turn the
scales of nomination in favor of any person whom the central clique of
the party, controlled as it has always been by Wall Street financiers,
may foist upon a disgusted people, as they have done in the case of
Harding. So long as the South remains solid, so long will the Republican
delegates from the South consist of only this handful of hirelings; so
long will they be amenable to the “discipline” which means the pressure
of the jobs by which they get their bread. Therefore the Republican
leaders will know that the solidarity of the South is their most
valuable asset; and they are least likely to do anything that will break
that solidarity. The Republican party’s only interest in the Negro is to
get his vote for nothing; and so long as Negro Republican leaders remain
the contemptible grafters and political procurers that they are at
present, so long will it get Negro votes for nothing.</p>
<p>Through it all the Republican party remains the most corrupt
influence among Negro Americans. It buys up by jobs, appointments and
gifts those Negroes who in politics should be the free and independent
spokesmen of Negro Americans. But worse than this is its private work in
which it secretly subsidizes men who pose before the public as
independent radicals. These intellectual pimps draw private
supplementary incomes from the Republican party to sell out the
influence of any movement, church or newspaper with which they are
connected. Of the enormity of this mode of procedure and the extent to
which it saps the very springs of Negro integrity the average Negro
knows nothing. Its blighting, baleful influence is known only to those
who have trained ears to hear and trained eyes to see.</p>
<p>And now in this election the standards will advance and the cohorts
go forward under the simple impulse of the same corrupting influence.
But whether the new movement for a Negro party comes to a head or not,
the new Negro in America will never amount to anything politically until
he enfranchises himself from the Grand Old Party which has made a
political joke of him. —July, 1920.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-v.-the-problems-of-leadership.">CHAPTER V.<br>THE
PROBLEMS OF LEADERSHIP.</h2>
<p>[In all the tangles of our awakening race consciousness there are
perhaps none more knotty than the tangles relating to leadership.
Leadership among Negro Americans, as among other people, means the
direction of a group’s activities, whether by precept, example or
compulsion. But, in our case, there is involved a strikingly new
element. Should the leading of our group in any sense be the product of
our group’s consciousness or of a consciousness originating from outside
that group? What the new Negro thinks on the problem of “outside
interference” in the leadership of his group is expressed in the first
and sixth editorials of this chapter, one of which appeared in <em>The
Voice</em> and the other in <em>The Negro World</em>.</p>
<p>“A Tender Point” formulates one part of the problem of leadership
which is seldom touched upon by Negro Americans who characteristically
avoid any public presentation of a thing about which they will talk
interminably in private; namely, the claim advanced, explicitly and
implicitly, by Negroids of mixed blood to be considered the natural
leaders of Negro activities on the ground of some alleged “superiority”
inherent in their white blood.</p>
<p>“The Descent of Du Bois” was written at the request of Major Loving
of the Intelligence Department of the Army at the time when Dr. Du Bois,
the editor of <em>The Crisis</em>, was being preened for a desk
captaincy at Washington. Major Loving solicited a summary of the
situation from me as one of those “radicals” qualified to furnish such a
summary. This he incorporated in his report to his superiors in
Washington, and this I published a week later in <em>The Voice</em> of
July 25, 1918, as an editorial without changing a single word. I was
informed by Major Loving that this editorial was one of the main causes
of the government’s change of intention as regards the Du Bois
captaincy. Since that time Dr. Du Bois’s white friends have been
fervidly ignoring the occurrence and the consequent collapse of his
leadership. “When the Blind Lead” was written as a reminder to the souls
of black folks that “while it is as easy as eggs for a leader to fall
off the fence, it is devilishly difficult to boost him up again.” “Just
Crabs” was a delightful inspiration in the course of defending, not
Mr. Garvey personally, but the principles of the New Negro Manhood
Movement, a portion of which had been incorporated by him and his
followers of the U.N.I.A. and A.C. L. It was the opening gun of the
defense, of which some other salvos were given in the serial satire of
The Crab Barrel—which I have been kind enough to omit from this record.
This controversy also gave rise to the three first editorials of chapter
6.]</p>
<h3 id="our-professional-friends">Our Professional “Friends”</h3>
<p>This country of ours has produced many curious lines of endeavor, not
the least curious of which is the business known as “being the Negro’s
friend.” It was first invented by politicians, but was taken up later by
“good” men, sixper-cent philanthropists, millionaire believers in
“industrial education,” benevolent newspapers like the <em>Evening
Post</em>, and a host of smaller fry of the “superior race.” Just at
this time the business is being worked to death, and we wish to
contribute our mite toward the killing-by showing what it means.</p>
<p>The first great “friend” of the Negro was the Southern politician,
Henry Clay, who, in the first half of the nineteenth century organized
the American Colonization Society. This society befriended the “free men
of color” by raising funds to ship them away to Liberia, which was
accepted by many free Negroes as a high proof of the white man’s
“friendship.” But Frederick Douglass, William Still, James McCune Smith,
Martin R. Delaney, and other wide-awake Negroes were able to show (by
transcripts of its proceedings) that its real purpose was to get rid of
the free Negroes because, so long as they continued to live here, their
freedom was an inducement to the slaves to run away from slavery, and
their accomplishments demonstrated to all white people that the Negro
(contrary to the claims of the slave-holders) was capable of a higher
human destiny than that of being chattels—and this was helping to make
American slavery odious in the eyes of the civilized world.</p>
<p>Since that time the dismal farce of “friendship” has been played many
times, by politicians, millionaires and their editorial adherents, who
have been profuse in giving good advice to the Negro people. They have
advised them to “go slow,” that “Rome was not built in a day,” and that
“half a loaf is better than no bread,” that “respect could not be
demanded,” and, in a thousand different ways have advised them that if
they would only follow the counsels of “the good white people” who
really had their interests at heart, instead of following their own
counsels (as the Irish and the Jews do), all would yet be well. Many
Negroes who have a wish-bone where their back-bone ought to be have been
doing this. It was as a representative of this class that Mitchell’s
man, Mr. Fred R. Moore, the editor of <em>The Age</em>, spoke, when in
July he gave utterance to the owlish reflection that,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Negro race is afflicted with many individuals whose wagging
tongues are apt to lead them into indiscreet utterances that reflect
upon the whole race. … The unruly tongues should not be allowed to
alienate public sympathy from the cause of the oppressed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It was as a fairly good representative of the class of “good white
friends of the colored people” that Miss Mary White Ovington, the
chairman of the New York Branch of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, sent to <em>The Voice</em> the following
bossy and dictatorial note:</p>
<div class="letter">
<p>
My dear Mr. Harrison,
<p>
<p>
I don’t see any reason for another organization, or another paper. If
you printed straight socialism it might be different.
<p>
<p>
Yours truly,
<p>
<p class="signature">
MARY W. OVINGTON.
<p>
</div>
<p>These “good white people” must really forgive us for insisting that
we are not children, and that, while we want all the friends we can get,
we need no benevolent dictators. It is we, and not they, who must shape
Negro policies. If they want to help in carrying them out we will
appreciate their help.</p>
<p>Just now the white people even in the South—have felt the pressure of
the new Negro’s manhood demands, in spite of the fact that
backward-looking Negroes like <em>The Age</em>’s editor condemn the
inflexible spirit of these demands. All over the South, the white
papers, scared by the exodus of Negro laborers who are tired of begging
for justice overdue, are saying that we are right, and friendlier
legislation has begun to appear on Southern statute books. Mr. Mencken
and other Southern writers are saying that the Negro is demanding, and
that the South had better accede to his just demands, as it is only a
matter of time when he will be in position to enforce them. One should
think, then, that those who have been parading as our professional
friends would be in the van of this manhood movement. But the movement
seems to have left them in the rear. Now, that we are demanding the
whole loaf, they are begging for half, and are angry at us for going
further than they think “nice.”</p>
<p>It was the N.A.A.C.P. which was urging us to compromise our manhood
by begging eagerly for “Jim Crow” training camps. And the same group is
asking, in the November <em>Crisis</em>, that we put a collective
power-of-attorney into their hand and leave it to them to shape our
national destiny. The N.A.A.C.P. has done much good work for
Negroes—splendid work—in fighting lynching and segregation. For that we
owe it more gratitude and good will than we owe to the entire Republican
party for the last sixty years of its existence. But we cannot, even in
this case, abdicate our right to shape more radical policies for
ourselves. It was the realization of the need for a more radical policy
than that of the N.A.A.C.P. that called into being the Liberty League of
Negro Americans. And the N.A.A.C.P., as mother, must forgive its
offspring for forging farther ahead.</p>
<p>Then, there is the case of the New York <em>Evening Post</em>, of
which Mr. Villard is owner. This paper was known far and wide as “a
friend to Negroes.” But its friendship has given way to indifference and
worse. In the good old days every lynching received editorial
condemnation. But the three great lynchings this year which preceded
East St. Louis found no editorial of condemnation in the <em>Post</em>.
It was more than luke-warm then. But, alack and alas! As soon as the
Negro soldiers in Houston, goaded to retaliation by gross indignities,
did some shooting on their own account, the <em>Evening Post</em>, which
had no condemnation of the conduct of the lynchers, joined the chorus of
those who were screaming for “punishment” and death. Here is its brief
editorial on August 25th:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As no provocation could justify the crimes committed by mutinous
Negro soldiers at Houston, Texas, so no condemnation of their conduct
can be too severe. It may be that the local authorities were not wholly
blameless, and that the commanding officers were at fault in not
foreseeing the trouble and taking steps to guard against it. But nothing
can really palliate the offence of the soldiers. They were false to
their uniform; they were false to their race. In one sense, this is the
most deplorable aspect of the whole riotous outbreak. It will play
straight into the hands of men like Senator Vardaman who have been
saying that it was dangerous to draft colored men into the army. And the
feeling against having colored troops encamped in the South will be
intensified. The grievous harm which they might do to their own people
should have been all along in the minds of the colored soldiers, and
made them doubly circumspect. They were under special obligation, in
addition to their military oath, to conduct themselves so as not to
bring reproach upon the Negroes as a whole, of whom they were in a sort
representative. Their criminal outrage will tend to make people forget
the good work done by other Negro soldiers. After the rigid
investigation which the War Department has ordered, the men found guilty
should receive the severest punishment. As for the general army policy
affecting colored troops, we are glad to see that Secretary Baker
appears to intend no change in his recent orders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We ourselves cannot forget that while the question of whether the
<em>Post’s</em> editor would get a diplomatic appointment (like some
other editors) was under consideration during the first year of Woodrow
Wilson’s first administration, the <em>Post</em> pretended to believe
that the President didn’t know of the segregation practiced in the
government departments. The N.A.A.C.P., whose letter sent out at the
time is now before us, pretended to the same effect.</p>
<p>After viewing these expressions of frightful friendliness in our own
times, we have reached the conclusion that the time has come when we
should insist on being our own best friends. We may make mistakes, of
course, but we ought to be allowed to make our own mistakes—as other
people are allowed to do. If friendship is to mean compulsory compromise
foisted on us by kindly white people, or by cultured Negroes whose ideal
is the imitation of the urbane acquiescence of these white friends, then
we had better learn to look a gift horse in the mouth whenever we get
the chance. —November, 1917.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="shillady-resigns">Shillady Resigns</h3>
<p>Mr. John R. Shillady, ex-secretary of the N.A.A.C.P., states in his
letter of resignation that “I am less confident than heretofore of the
speedy success of the association’s full program and of the probability
of overcoming within a reasonable period the forces opposed to Negro
equality by the means and methods which are within the association’s
power to employ.” In this one sentence Mr. Shillady, the worker on the
inside, puts in suave and serenely diplomatic phrase the truth which
people on the outside have long ago perceived, namely, that the
N.A.A.C.P. makes a joke of itself when it affects to think that lynching
and the other evils which beset the Negro in the South can be abolished
by simple publicity. The great weakness of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People has been and is that, whereas it aims
to secure certain results by affecting the minds of white people and
making them friendly to it, it has no control over these minds and has
absolutely no answer to the question, “What steps do you propose to take
if these minds at which you are aiming remain unaffected? What do you
propose to do to secure life and liberty for the Negro if the white
Southerner persists, as he has persisted for sixty years, in refusing to
grant guarantees of life and liberty?” The N.A.A.C.P. has done some good
and worth-while work as an organization of protest. But the times call
for something more effective than protests addressed to the other
fellow’s consciousness. What is needed at present is more of the
mobilizing of the Negro’s political power, pocketbook power and
intellectual power (which are absolutely within the Negro’s own control)
to do for the Negro the things which the Negro needs to have done
without depending upon or waiting for the co-operative action of white
people. This co-operative action, whenever it does come, is a boon that
no Negro, intelligent or unintelligent, affects to despise. But no Negro
of clear vision, whether he be a leader or not, can afford to predicate
the progress of the Negro upon such co-operative action, because it may
not come.</p>
<p>Mr. Shillady may have seen these things. It is high time that all
Negroes see these things whether their white professional friends see
them or not. —July, 1920.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="our-white-friends">Our White Friends</h3>
<p>In the good old days when the black man’s highest value in the white
man’s eye was that of an object of benevolence especially provided by
the Divine mind for calling out those tender out-pourings of charity
which were so dear to the self-satisfied Caucasian—in those days the
white men who fraternized with black people could do so as their guides,
philosophers and friends without incurring any hostility on the part of
black folk. Today, however, the white man who mixes with the black
brother is having a hard time of it. Somehow Ham’s offspring no longer
feels proud of being “taken up” by the progeny of Japhet. And when the
white man insists on mixing in with him the colored brother will persist
in attributing ulterior motives.</p>
<p>What is the cause of this difference? The answer will be found only
by one who refuses to wear the parochial blinkers of Anglo-Saxon
civilization and sees that the relations of the white and black race
have changed and are changing all over the world. Such an observer would
note that the most significant fact of the growing race consciousness is
to be found in the inevitable second half of the word. It isn’t because
these darker people are motivated by race that their present state of
mind constitutes a danger to Caucasian overlordship. It is because they
have developed consciousness, intelligence, understanding. They have
learned that the white brother is perfectly willing to love them—“in
their place.” They have learned that that place is one in which they are
not to develop brains and initiative, but must furnish the brawn and
muscle whereby the white man’s brain and initiative can take eternally
the products of their brawn and muscle. There are today many white men
who will befriend the Negro, who will give their dollars to his comfort
and welfare, so long as the idea of what constitutes that comfort and
welfare comes entirely from the white man’s mind. Examples like those of
Dr. Spingarn and Mr. E. D. Morel are numerous.</p>
<p>And not for nothing does the black man balk at the white man’s
“mixing in.” For there are spies everywhere and the <em>agent
provocateur</em> is abroad in the land. From Chicago comes the news by
way of the Associated Press (white) that Dr. Jonas, who has always
insisted in sticking his nose into the Negro peoples’ affairs as their
guide, philosopher and friend, has been forced to confess that he is a
government agent, presumably paid for things which the government would
later suppress. Dr. Jonas is reported to have said that he is connected
with the British secret service; but since the second year of the
European war it has been rather difficult for us poor devils to tell
where the American government ended and the British government began,
especially in these matters. In any case, we have Dr. Jonas’ confession,
and all the silly Negroes who listened approvingly to the senseless
allegations made by Messrs. Jonas, Gabriel and others of a standing army
of 4,000,000 in Abyssinia and of Japanese-Abyssinian diplomatic
relations and intentions, must feel now very foolish about the final
result.</p>
<p>How natural it was that Jonas, the white leader, should have gone
scot free, while Redding and his other Negro dupes are held! How natural
that Jonas should be the one to positively identify Redding as the
slayer of the Negro policeman! And so, once again, that section of the
Negro race that will not follow except where a white man leads will have
to pay that stern penalty whereby Dame Experience teaches her dunces.
Under the present circumstances we, the Negroes of the Western world, do
pledge our allegiance to leaders of our own race, selected by our own
group and supported financially and otherwise exclusively by us. Their
leadership may be wise or otherwise; they may make mistakes here and
there; nevertheless, such sins as they may commit will be our sins, and
all the glory that they may achieve will be our glory. We prefer it so.
It may be worth the while of the white men who desire to be “Our
Professional Friends” to take note of this preference.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-tender-point">A Tender Point</h3>
<p>When the convention of turtles assembled on the Grand Banks of
Newfoundland it was found absolutely impossible to get a tortoise
elected as leader. All turtles, conservative and radical, agreed that a
land and water creature, who was half one thing and half another, was
not an ideal choice for leader of a group which lived exclusively in the
water. Whenever a leader of the Irish has to be selected by the Irish it
is an Irishman who is selected. No Irishman would be inclined to dispute
the fact that other men, even Englishmen like John Stuart Mill and the
late Keir Hardie, could feel the woes of Ireland as profoundly as any
Irishman. But they prefer to live up to the principle of “Safety
First.”</p>
<p>These two illustrations are to be taken as a prelude to an important
point which is not often discussed in the Negro press because all of
us—black, brown and parti-colored—fear to offend each other. That point
concerns the biological breed of persons who should be selected by
Negroes as leaders of their race. We risk the offense this time because
efficiency in matters of racial leadership, as in other matters, should
not be too tender to these points of prejudice when they stand in the
way of desirable results. For two centuries in America we, the
descendants of the black Negroes of Africa, have been told by white men
that we cannot and will not amount to anything except in so far as we
first accept the bar sinister of their mixing with us. Always when white
people had to select a leader for Negroes they would select some one who
had in his veins the blood of the selectors. In the good old days when
slavery was in flower, it was those whom Denmark Vesey of Charleston
described as “house niggers” who got the master’s cast-off clothes, the
better scraps of food and culture which fell from the white man’s table,
who were looked upon as the Talented Tenth of the Negro race. The
opportunities of self-improvement, in so far as they lay within the hand
of the white race, were accorded exclusively to this class of people who
were the left-handed progeny of the white masters.</p>
<p>Out of this grew a certain attitude on their part towards the rest of
the Negro people which, unfortunately, has not yet been outgrown. In
Washington, Boston, Charleston, New York and Chicago these proponents of
the lily-white idea are prone to erect around their sacred personalities
a high wall of caste, based on the ground of color. And the black
Negroes have heretofore worshipped at the altars erected on these walls.
One sees this in the Baptist, Methodist and Episcopal churches, at the
various conventions and in fraternal organizations. Black people
themselves seem to hold the degrading view that a man who is but half a
Negro is twice as worthy of their respect and support as one who is
entirely black. We have seen in the social life of some of the places
mentioned how women, undeniably black and undeniably beautiful, have
been shunned and ostracised at public functions by men who should be
presumed to know better. We have read the fervid jeremiads of “colored”
men who, when addressing the whites on behalf of some privilege which
they wished to share with them, would be, in words, as black as the ace
of spades, but, when it came to mixing with “their kind,” they were
professional lily-whites, and we have often had to point out to them
that there is no color prejudice in America—except among “colored”
people. Those who may be inclined to be angry at the broaching of this
subject are respectfully requested to ponder that pungent fact.</p>
<p>In this matter white people, even in America, are inclined to be more
liberal than colored people. If a white man has no race prejudice, it
will be found that he doesn’t care how black is the Negro friend that he
takes to his home and his bosom. Even these white people who pick
leaders for Negroes have begun in these latter years to give formal and
official expression to this principle. Thus it was that when the
trustees of Tuskegee had to elect a head of Tuskegee and a putative
leader of the Negroes of America to succeed the late Dr. Washington,
they argued that it was now necessary to select as leader for the Negro
people a man who could not be mistaken by any one for anything other
than a Negro. Therefore, Mr. Emmett Scott was passed over and Dr. Robert
R. Morton was selected. We are not approving here the results of that
selection, but merely holding up to Negroes the principle by which it
was governed.</p>
<p>So long as we ourselves acquiesce in the selection of leaders on the
ground of their unlikeness to our racial type, just so long will we be
met by the invincible argument that white blood is necessary to make a
Negro worth while. Every Negro who has respect for himself and for his
race will feel, when contemplating such examples as Toussaint
Louverture, Phyllis Wheatley, Paul Laurence Dunbar and Samuel Ringgold
Ward, the thrill of pride that differs in quality and intensity from the
feeling which he experiences when contemplating other examples of great
Negroes who are not entirely black. For it is impossible in such cases
for the white men to argue that they owed their greatness of their
prominence to the blood of the white race which was mingled in their
veins. It is a legitimate thrill of pride, for it gives us a hope nobler
than the hope of amalgamation whereby, in order to become men, we must
lose our racial identity. It is a subject for sober and serious
reflection, and it is hoped that sober and serious reflection will be
given to it.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-descent-of-du-bois">The Descent of Du Bois</h3>
<p>In a recent bulletin of the War Department it was declared that
“justifiable grievances” were producing and had produced “not
disloyalty, but an amount of unrest and bitterness which even the best
efforts of their leaders may not be able always to guide.” This is the
simple truth. The essence of the present situation lies in the fact that
the people whom our white masters have “recognized” as our leaders
(without taking the trouble to consult us) and those who, by our own
selection, had actually attained to leadership among us are being
revaluated and, in most cases, rejected.</p>
<p>The most striking instance from the latter class is Dr. W. E. Du
Bois, the editor of the <em>Crisis</em>. Du Bois’s case is the more
significant because his former services to his race have been
undoubtedly of a high and courageous sort. Moreover, the act by which he
has brought upon himself the stormy outburst of disapproval from his
race is one which of itself, would seem to merit no such stern
condemnation. To properly gauge the value and merit of this disapproval
one must view it in the light of its attendant circumstances and of the
situation in which it arose.</p>
<p>Dr. Du Bois first palpably sinned in his editorial “Close Ranks” in
the July number of the <em>Crisis</em>. But this offense (apart from the
trend and general tenor of the brief editorial) lies in a single
sentence: “Let us, while this war lasts, <em>forget our special
grievances</em> and close our ranks, shoulder to shoulder with our white
fellow-citizens and the allied nations that are fighting for democracy.”
From the latter part of the sentence there is no dissent, so far as we
know. The offense lies in that part of the sentence which ends with the
italicized words. It is felt by all his critics, that Du Bois, of all
Negroes, knows best that our “special grievances” which the War
Department Bulletin describes as “justifiable” consist of lynching,
segregation and disfranchisement, and that the Negroes of America can
not preserve either their lives, their manhood or their vote (which is
their political life and liberties) with these things in existence. The
doctor’s critics feel that America can not use the Negro people to any
good effect unless they have life, liberty and manhood assured and
guaranteed to them. Therefore, instead of the war for democracy making
these things less necessary, it makes them more so.</p>
<p>“But,” it may be asked, “why should not these few words be taken
merely as a slip of the pen or a venial error in logic? Why all this
hubbub?” It is because the so-called leaders of the first-mentioned
class have already established an unsavory reputation by advocating this
same surrender of life, liberty and manhood, masking their cowardice
behind the pillars of war-time sacrifice? Du Bois’s statement, then, is
believed to mark his entrance into that class, and is accepted as a
“surrender” of the principles which brought him into prominence—and
which alone kept him there.</p>
<p>Later, when it was learned that Du Bois was being preened for a berth
in the War Department as a captain-assistant (adjutant) to Major
Spingarn, the words used by him in the editorial acquired a darker and
more sinister significance. The two things fitted too well together as
motive and self-interest.</p>
<p>For these reasons Du Bois is regarded much in the same way as a
knight in the middle ages who had had his armor stripped from him, his
arms reversed and his spurs hacked off. This ruins him as an influential
person among Negroes at this time, alike whether he becomes a captain or
remains an editor.</p>
<p>But the case has its roots much farther back than the editorial in
July’s <em>Crisis</em>. Some time ago when it was learned that the
<em>Crisis</em> was being investigated by the government for an alleged
seditious utterance a great clamor went up, although the expression of
it was not open. Negroes who dared to express their thoughts seemed to
think the action tantamount to a declaration that protests against
lynching, segregation and disfranchisement were outlawed by the
government. But nothing was clearly understood until the conference of
editors was called under the assumed auspices of Emmet Scott and Major
Spingarn. Then it began to appear that these editors had not been called
without a purpose. The desperate ambiguity of the language which they
used in their report in the War Department Bulletin), coupled with the
fact that not one of them, upon his return would tell the people
anything of the proceedings of the conference—all this made the Negroes
feel less and less confidence in them and their leadership; made them
(as leaders) less effective instruments for the influential control of
the race’s state of mind.</p>
<p>Now Du Bois was one of the most prominent of those editors “who were
called.” The responsibility, therefore, for a course of counsel which
stresses the servile virtues of acquiescence and subservience falls
squarely on his shoulders. The offer of a captaincy and Du Bois’s
firtation with that offer following on the heels of these things seemed,
even in the eyes of his associate members of the N.A.A.C.P. to afford
clear proof of that which was only a suspicion before, viz: that the
racial resolution of the leaders had been tampered with, and that Du
Bois had been privy to something of the sort. The connection between the
successive acts of the drama (May, June, July) was too clear to admit of
any interpretation other than that of deliberate, cold blooded,
purposive planning. And the connection with Spingarn seemed to suggest
that personal friendships and public faith were not good working
team-mates.</p>
<p>For the sake of the larger usefulness of Dr. Du Bois we hope he will
be able to show that he can remain as editor of the <em>Crisis</em>; but
we fear that it will require a good deal of explaining. For, our
leaders, like Caesar’s wife, must be above suspicion. —July, 1918.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="when-the-blind-lead">When the Blind Lead</h3>
<p>In the February issue of the <em>Crisis</em> its editor begins a
brief editorial on “Leadership,” with the touching reminder that “Many a
good cause has been killed by suspected leadership.” How strikingly do
these words bring back to us Negroes those dark days of 1918! At that
time the editor of the <em>Crisis</em> was offering certain unique
formulas of leadership that somehow didn’t “take.” His “Close Ranks”
editorial and the subsequent slump in the stock of his leadership have
again illustrated the truth long since expressed in Latin: “Descensus
Averni facilis; sed revocare gradus,—hoc opus est,” which, being
translated, might mean that, while it’s as easy as eggs for a leader to
fall off the fence, it is devilishly difficult to boost him up again. In
September, 1918, one could boldly say, “The <em>Crisis</em> says, first
your Country, then your Rights!” Today, when the Negro people everywhere
are responding to Mr. Michael Coulsen’s sentiment that “it’s Race, not
Country, first,” we find the “leader” of 1918 in the position described
by Lowell in these words: “A moultin’ fallen cherubim, ef he should see
ye’d snicker, Thinkin’ he warn’t a suckemstance.”</p>
<p>How fast time flies!</p>
<p>But the gist of Dr. Du Bois’s editorial is the moral downfall of
another great leader. “Woodrow Wilson, in following a great ideal of
world unity, forgot all his pledges to the German people, forgot all his
large words to Russia, did not hesitate to betray Gompers and his
unions, <em>and never at any single moment meant to include in his
democracy twelve million of his fellow Americans, whom he categorically
promised “more than mere grudging justice,” and then allowed 350 of them
to be lynched during his Presidency.</em> Under such leadership what
cause could succeed?” He notes that out of the World War, with the
Allies triumphant, have come Britain’s brutal domination of the seas,
her conquest of Persia, Arabia and Egypt, and her tremendous tyranny
imposed on two-thirds of Africa.</p>
<p>But we saw these things, as early as 1917, to be the necessary
consequences of the Allies’ success, when the editor of the
<em>Crisis</em> was telling his race: “You are not fighting simply for
Europe; you are fighting for the world.” Was Dr. Du Bois so blind then
that he couldn’t see them? And if he was, is he any less blind today? In
1918 the lynchings were still going on while Dr. Du Bois was solemnly
advising us to “forget our grievances.” Any one who insisted then on
putting such grievances as lynchings, disfranchisement and segregation
in the fore-ground was described by the <em>Crisis</em>’ editor as
seeking “to turn his country’s tragic predicament to his own personal
gain.” At that time he either believed or pretended to believe every one
of the empty words that flowed from Woodrow Wilson’s lips, and on the
basis of this belief he was willing to act as a brilliant bellwether to
the rest of the flock. Unfortunately, the flock refused to follow the
lost leader.</p>
<p>“If the blind lead the blind they will both fall into the ditch.” But
in this case those being led were not quite so blind as those who wanted
to lead them by way of captaincies in the army. Which was why some
captaincies were not forthcoming. The test of vision in a leader is the
ability to foresee the immediate future, the necessary consequences of a
course of conduct and the dependable sentiments of those whom he assumes
to lead. In all these things Dr. Du Bois has failed; and neither his
ungrateful attack on Emmett Scott nor his belated discovery of Wilsonian
hypocrisy will, we fear, enable him to climb back into the saddle of
race leadership. This is a pity, because he has rendered good service in
his day. But that day is past. The magazine which he edits still remains
as a splendid example of Negro journalism. But the personal primacy of
its editor has departed, never to return. Other times, other men; other
men, other manners.</p>
<p>Even the Negro people are now insisting that their leaders shall in
thought and moral stamina keep ahead of, and not behind, them,</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse leadingquote">
“It takes a mind like Willum’s [fact!) ez big as all outdoors
</div>
<div class="verse">
To find out thet it looks like rain arter it fairly pours.”
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The people’s spiritual appetite has changed and they are no longer
enamoured of “brilliant” leaders, whose chorus is:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse leadingquote">
“A marciful Providence fashioned us holler
</div>
<div class="verse">

It can hold any quantity on ’em—the belly can—
</div>
<div class="verse">
An’ bring ’em up ready fer use like the pelican.”
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>And this is a change which we commend to the kindly consideration of
all those good white friends who are out selecting Negro “leaders.” It
is a fact which, when carefully considered, will save them thousands of
dollars in “overhead expense.” The Negro leaders of the future will be
expected not only to begin straight, take a moral vacation, and then go
straight again. They will be expected to go straight all the time; to
stand by us in war as well as in peace; not to blow hot and cold with
the same mouth, but “to stand four-square to all the winds that blow.”

<h3 id="just-crabs">Just Crabs</h3>
<p>Once upon a time a Greedy Person went rummaging along the lagoon with
a basket and a stick in quest of Crabs, which he needed for the Home
Market. (Now, this was in the Beginning of Things, Best Beloved.) These
were Land Crabs—which, you know, are more luscious than Sea Crabs, being
more Primitive and more full of meat. He dug into their holes with his
stick, routed them out, packed them on their backs in his basket and
took them home. Several trips he made with his basket and his stick, and
all the Crabs which he caught were dumped into a huge barrel. (But this
time he didn’t pack them on their backs.) And all the creatures stood
around and watched. For this Greedy Person had put no cover on the
barrel. (But this was in the Beginning of Things.)</p>
<p>He knew Crab Nature, and was not at all worried about his Crabs. For
as soon as any one Crab began to climb up on the side of the barrel to
work his way toward the top the other Crabs would reach up, grab him by
the legs, and down he would come, kerplunk! “If we can’t get up,” they
would say—“if we can’t get up, you shan’t get up, either. We’ll pull you
down. Besides, you should wait until the barrel bursts. There are Kind
Friends on the Outside who will burst, the barrel if we only wait, and
then, when the Great Day dawns, we will all be Emancipated and there’ll
be no need for Climbing. Come down, you fool!” (Because this was in the
Beginning of Things, Best Beloved.) So the Greedy Person could always
get as many Crabs as he needed for the Home Market, because they all
depended on him for their food.</p>
<p>And all the creatures stood around and laughed. For this was very
funny in the Beginning of Things. And all the creatures said that the
Reason for this kink in Crab Nature was that when the Creator was giving
out heads he didn’t have enough to go around, so the poor Crabs didn’t
get any.</p>
<p>And the Greedy Person thanked his lucky stars that Crabs had been
made in that Peculiar way, since it made it unnecessary to put a cover
on his barrel or to waste his precious time a-watching of them. (Now,
all this happened long ago, Best Beloved, in the very Beginning of
Things.)</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The above is the first of our Just-So Stories—with no apologies to
Rudyard Kipling or any one else. We print it here because, just at this
time the Crabs are at work in Harlem, and there is a tremendous clashing
of claws as the Pull ’Em Down program goes forward. It’s a great game,
to be sure, but it doesn’t seem to get them or us anywhere. The new day
that has dawned for the Negroes of Harlem is a day of business
accomplishment. People are going into business, saving their money and
collectively putting it into enterprises which will mean roofs over
their heads and an economic future for themselves and their little
ones.</p>
<p>But the Subsidized Sixth are sure that this is all wrong and that we
have no right to move an inch until the Socialist millennium dawns, when
we will all get “out of the barrel” together. It does not seem to have
occurred to them that making an imperfect heaven now does not unfit any
one for enjoying the perfect paradise which they promise us—if it ever
comes. Truly it is said of them that “the power over a man’s subsistence
is the power over his will”—and over his “scientific radicalism,” too.
But we remember having translated this long ago into the less showy
English of “Show me whose bread you eat, and I’ll tell you whose songs
you’ll sing.” Surely this applies to radicals overnight as well as to
ordinary folk. And if not, why not?</p>
<p>But when the reek of the poison gas propaganda has cleared away and
the smoke of the barrage has lifted it will be found that “White Men’s
Niggers” is a phrase that need not be restricted to old-line politicians
and editors. Criticism pungent and insistent is due to every man in
public life and to every movement which bids for public support. But the
cowardly insinuator who from the safe shelter of nameless charges
launches his poisoned arrows at other people’s reputation is a
contemptible character to have on any side of any movement. He is
generally a liar who fears that he will be called to account for his
lies if he should venture to name his foe. No man with the truth to tell
indulges in this pastime of the skulker and the skunk. Let us, by all
means, have clear, hard-hitting criticism, but none of this foul filth
which lowers the thing that throws it. In the name of common sense and
common decency, quit being Just Crabs.</p>

RACE CONSCIOUSNESS.</h2>
<h3 id="the-negros-own-radicalism">The Negro’s Own Radicalism</h3>
<p>Twenty years ago all Negroes known to the white publicists of America
could be classed as conservatives on all the great questions on which
thinkers differ. In matters of industry, commerce, politics, religion,
they could be trusted to take the backward view. Only on the question of
the Negro’s “rights” could a small handful be found bold enough to be
tagged as “radicals”—and they were howled down by both the white and
colored adherents of the conservative point of view. Today Negroes
differ on all those great questions on which white thinkers differ, and
there are Negro radicals of every imaginary stripe—agnostics, atheists,
I.W.W.’s Socialists, Single Taxers, and even Bolshevists.</p>
<p>In the good old days white people derived their knowledge of what
Negroes were doing from those Negroes who were nearest to them,
generally their own selected exponents of Negro activity or of their
white point of view. A classic illustration of this kind of knowledge
was afforded by the Republican Party; but the Episcopal Church, the
Urban League, or the U. S. Government would serve as well. Today the
white world is vaguely, but disquietingly, aware that Negroes are awake,
different and perplexingly uncertain. Yet the white world by which they
are surrounded retains its traditional method of interpreting the mass
by the Negro nearest to themselves in affiliation or contact. The
Socialist party thinks that the “unrest” now apparent in the Negro
masses is due to the propaganda which its adherents support, and
believes that it will function largely along the lines of socialist
political thought. The great dailies, concerned mainly with their chosen
task of being the mental bellwethers of the mob, scream “Bolshevist
propaganda” and flatter themselves that they have found the true cause;
while the government’s unreliable agents envisage it as “disloyalty.”
The truth, as usual, is to be found in the depths; but there they are
all prevented from going by mental laziness and that traditional
off-handed, easy contempt with which white men in America, from scholars
like Lester Ward to scavengers like Stevenson, deign to consider the
colored population of twelve millions.</p>
<p>In the first place, the cause of “radicalism” among American Negroes
is international. But it is necessary to draw clear distinctions at the
outset. The function of the Christian church is international. So is
art, war, the family, rum and the exploitation of labor. But none of
these is entitled to extend the mantle of its own peculiar
“internationalism” to cover the present case of the Negro
discontent—although this has been attempted. The international Fact to
which Negroes in America are now reacting is not the exploitation of
laborers by capitalists; but the social, political and economic
subjection of colored peoples by white. It is not the Class Line, but
the Color Line, which is the incorrect but accepted expression for the
Dead Line of racial inferiority. This fact is a fact of Negro
consciousness as well as a fact of externals. The international Color
Line is the practice and theory of that doctrine which holds that the
best stocks of Africa, China, Egypt and the West Indies are inferior to
the worst stocks of Belgium, England and Italy, and must hold their
lives, lands and liberties upon such terms and conditions as the white
races may choose to grant them.</p>
<p>On the part of the whites, the motive was originally economic; but it
is no longer purely so. All the available facts go to prove that,
whether in the United States or in Africa or China, the economic
subjection is without exception keener and more brutal when the
exploited are black, brown and yellow, than when they are white. And the
fact that black, brown and yellow also exploit each other brutally
whenever Capitalism has created the economic classes of plutocrat and
proletarian should suffice to put purely economic subjection out of
court as the prime cause of racial unrest. For the similarity of
suffering has produced in all lands where whites rule colored races a
certain similarity of sentiment, viz.: a racial revulsion of racial
feeling. The peoples of those lands begin to feel and realize that they
are so subjected because they are members of races condemned as
“inferior” by their Caucasian overlords. The fact presented to their
minds is one of race, and in terms of race do they react to it. Put the
case to any Negro by way of test and the answer will make this
clear.</p>
<p>The great World War, by virtue of its great advertising campaign for
democracy and the promises which were held out to all subject peoples,
fertilized the Race Consciousness of the Negro people into the stage of
conflict with the dominant white idea of the Color Line. They took
democracy at its face value—which is—equality. So did the Hindus,
Egyptians and West Indians. This is what the hypocritical advertisers of
democracy had not bargained for. The American Negroes, like the other
darker peoples, are presenting their checques and trying to “cash in,”
and delays in that process, however unavoidable to the paying tellers,
are bound to beget a plentiful lack of belief in either their intention
or their ability to pay. Hence the run on Democracy’s bank—“the Negro
unrest” of the newspaper paragraphers.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly some of these newly-awakened Negroes will take to
Socialism and Bolshevism. But here again the reason is racial. Since
they suffer racially from the world as at present organized by the white
race, some of their ablest hold that it is “good play” to encourage and
give aid to every subversive movement within that white world which
makes for its destruction “as it is.” For by its subversion they have
much to gain and nothing to lose. Yet they build on their own
foundations. Parallel with the dogma of Class-Consciousness they run the
dogma of Race-Consciousness. And they dig deeper. For the roots of
Class-Consciousness inhere in a temporary economic order; whereas the
roots of Race-Consciousness must of necessity survive any and all
changes in the economic order. Accepting biology, as a fact, their view
is the more fundamental. At any rate, it is that view with which the
white world will have to deal. —The <em>New Negro</em>, October,
1919.</p>

<h3 id="race-first-versus-class-first">Race First Versus Class
First</h3>
<p>“In the old days white people derived their knowledge of what Negroes
were doing from those Negroes who were nearest to them, largely their
own selected exponents of Negro activity or of their white point of
view. * * * Today the white world is vaguely, but disquietingly, aware
that Negroes are awake; different. but perplexingly uncertain. Yet the
white world by which they are surrounded retains its traditional method
of interpreting the mass by the Negro nearest to themselves in
affiliation or contact. The Socialist party still persists in thinking
that the unrest now apparent in the Negro masses is due to the
propaganda which its paid adherents support, and believes that the
unrest will function largely along the lines of Socialist political
thought.” It is necessary to insist on this point today when the
Socialist party of America has secretly subsidized both a magazine and a
newspaper to attempt to cut into the splendid solidarity which Negroes
are achieving in response to the call of racial necessity. It is
necessary to point out that “radical” young Negroes may betray the
interests of the race into alien hands just as surely as “the old
crowd.” For, after all, the essence of both betrayals consists in making
the racial requirements play second fiddle to the requirements dictated
as best for it by other groups with other interests to serve. The fact
that one group of alien interests is described as “radical” and the
other as “reactionary” is of very slight value to us.</p>
<p>In the days when the Socialist Party of America was respectable,
although it never drew lines of racial separation in the North, it
permitted those lines to be drawn in the South. It had no word of
official condemnation for the Socialists of Tennessee who prevented
Theresa Malkiel in 1912 from lecturing to Negroes on Socialism either in
the same hall with them or in meetings of their own. It was the national
office of the party which in that same presidential year refused to
route Eugene V. Debs in the South because that Grand Old Man let it be
known that he would not remain silent on the race question while in the
South. They wanted the votes of the white South then, and were willing
to betray by silence the principles of inter-racial solidarity which
they espoused on paper.</p>
<p>Now, when their party has shrunk considerably in popular support and
sentiment, they are willing to take up our cause. Well, we thank honest
white people everywhere who take up our cause, but we wish them to know
that we have already taken it up ourselves. While they were refusing to
diagnose our case we diagnosed it ourselves, and, now that we have
prescribed the remedy—Race Solidarity—they come to us with their
prescription—Class Solidarity. It is too late, gentlemen! This racial
alignment is all our own product, and we have no desire to turn it over
to you at this late day, when we are beginning to reap its benefits. And
if you are simple enough to believe that those among us who serve your
interests ahead of ours have any monopoly of intellect or information
along the lines of modern learning, then you are the greater gulls
indeed.</p>
<p>We can respect the Socialists of Scandinavia, France, Germany or
England on their record. But your record so far does not entitle you to
the respect of those of us who can see all around a subject. We say Race
First, because you have all along insisted on Race First and class after
when you didn’t need our help. We reproduce below a brief portion of
your record in those piping times of peace, and ask you to explain it.
If you are unable to do so, set your lackeys to work; they may be able
to do it in terms of their own “radical scientific” surface slush. The
following is taken from the majority report of one of your national
committees during one of your recent national conventions. It was signed
by Ernest Untermann and J. Stitt Wilson, representing the West, and
Joshua Wanhope, editor of the <em>Call</em>, and Robert Hunter,
representing the East, and it was adopted as a portion of the party
program. We learn from it that—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Race feeling is not so much a result of social as of biological
evolution. It does not change essentially with changes of economic
systems. It is deeper than any class feeling and will outlast the
capitalist system. It persists even after race prejudice has been
outgrown. It exists not because the capitalists nurse it for economic
reasons, but the capitalists rather have an opportunity to nurse it for
economic reasons because it exists as a product of biology. It is bound
to play a role in the economics of the future society. If it should not
assert itself in open warfare under a Socialist form of society, it will
nevertheless lead to a rivalry of races for expansion over the globe as
a result of the play of natural and sexual selection. We may temper this
race feeling by education, but we can never hope to extinguish it
altogether. Class-consciousness must be learned, but race consciousness
is inborn and cannot be wholly unlearned. A few individuals may indulge
in the luxury of ignoring race and posing as utterly raceless
humanitarians, but whole races never. Where races struggle for the means
of life, racial animosities cannot be avoided. Where working people
struggle for jobs, self-preservation enforces its decrees. Economic and
political considerations lead to racial fights and to legislation
restricting the invasion of the white man’s domain by other races.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is well that the New Negro should know this, since it justifies
him in giving you a taste of your own medicine. The writer of these
lines is also a Socialist; but he refuses in this crisis of the world’s
history to put either Socialism or your party above the call of his
race. And he does this on the very grounds which you yourselves have
given in the document quoted above. Also because he is not a fool.

<h3 id="an-open-letter-to-the-socialist-party-of-new-york-city">An Open
Letter to the Socialist Party of New York City</h3>
<p>Gentlemen: During 1917 the white leaders of the Republican party were
warned that the Negroes of this city were in a mood unfavorable to the
success of their party at the polls and that this mood was likely to
last</p>
<p>until they changed their party’s attitude toward the Negro masses.
They scouted this warning because the Negroes whom they had selected to
interpret Negro sentiment for them still confidently assured them that
there had been no change of sentiment on the part of the Negro people,
and white politicians did not think it necessary to come and find out
for themselves. Consequently they were lied to by those whose bread and
butter depended on such lying. Then came the mayoralty campaign, and,
when it was too late they discovered their mistake. At a memorable
meeting at Palace Casino John Purroy Mitchell, the candidate of the
Republican party, and Theodore Roosevelt, its idol, were almost hissed
off the stage, while the Mitchell outdoor speakers found it impossible
to speak on the street corners of Harlem. The party went down to defeat
and Judge Hylan was elected.</p>
<p>All this is recent history, and it is called to your attention at
this time only because you are in danger of making a similar costly
mistake. You, too, have selected Negro spokesmen on whose word you
choose to rely for information as to the tone and temper of Negro
political sentiment. You have chosen to adopt the same faulty method of
the white Republican politicians, and you do not care to go behind the
word of your selected exponents of Negro thought and feeling. Yet the
pitiful vote which you polled in the last election might have warned you
that something had gone wrong in your arrangements. What that something
is we shall now proceed to show you—if you are still able to see.</p>
<p>During the recent world war the Negro in America was taught that
while white people spoke of patriotism, religion, democracy and other
sounding themes, they remained loyal to one concept above all others,
and that was the concept of race. Even in the throes of war, and on</p>
<p>the battlefields of France it was “race first” with them. Out of this
realization was born the new Negro ideal of “race first” for us. And
today, whether Negroes be Catholics or Protestants, capitalists or wage
workers, Republicans or Democrats, native or foreign-born, they begin
life anew on this basis. Alike in their business alignments, their
demands on the government and political parties, and in their courageous
response to race rioters, they are responding to this sentiment which
has been bred by the attitude of white men here and everywhere else
where white rules black. To be sure, neither Burleson nor Palmer have
told you or the rest of the white world this. The Angle-Saxon white man
is a notorious hypocrite; and they have preferred to prate of
Bolshevism—your “radicalism”—rather than tell the truth of racialism,
our “radicalism,” because this was an easier explanation, more in
keeping with official stupidity. But we had supposed that you were
intelligent enough to find this out. Evidently, you were not.</p>
<p>Your official Negro exponents, on behalf of their bread and butter,
have seized on this widely-published official explanation to make you
believe that the changed attitude of the Negro masses was due to the
propaganda which you were paying them (at their published request) to
preach. But this is a lie. Don’t take our word for it. Do some reading
on your own account. Get a hundred different Negro newspapers and
magazines, outside of those which you have subsidized, and study their
editorial and other pronouncements, and you will see that this is
so.</p>
<p>But let us come nearer home. The propaganda of Socialism has been
preached in times past in Harlem by different people without awakening
hostility of any sort. Today it elicits a hostility which is outspoken.
Send up and see; then ask yourselves the reason. You will find a Negro
Harlem reborn, with business enterprises and cultural arrangements. And
these things have been established without any help from you or those
who eat your bread. Even the work of Socialist propaganda was neglected
by you between 1912 and 1917. Consult your own memories and the columns
of the Call.</p>
<p>All these things are the recent products of the principle of “race
first.” And among them the biggest is the Universal Negro Improvement
Association, with its associate bodies, the Black Star Line and the
Negro Factories Corporation. No movement among American Negroes since
slavery was abolished has ever attained the gigantic proportions of
this. The love and loyalty of millions go out to it as well as the cold
cash of tens of thousands. Yet your Negro hirelings have seen fit to use
the organs which you have given them to spread Socialist propaganda for
the purpose of attacking all these things, and the Black Star Line in
particular. Do you wonder now that they meet with such outspoken
opposition that they have been driven to seek an underhanded alliance
with the police (as your Negro Socialist organ avows in its latest
issue)? Isn’t that a glorious alliance for purposes of Negro propaganda?
When such things can happen you may depend upon it that someone has been
fooling you.</p>
<p>And, just as the white Republicans did, you have assumed that those
whom chance or change brought your way have, somehow, achieved a
monopoly of the intellect and virtue of the Negro race. Do you think
that this is sound sense on your part? Of course, it was natural that
they should tell you so. But was it natural for you to be so simple as
to believe it? On March 27 this newspaper in an editorial quoted a
passage from one of your official documents showing that the white men
of your party officially put “race first” rather than “class first,”
which latter phrase is your henchmen’s sole contribution to
“sociology”—for us. The quoted passage cuts the very heart out of their
case. And yet, those whom you have selected to represent you are so
green and sappy in their Socialism that, although six weeks have elapsed
since this was hurled at their thick heads, not one of them has yet been
able to trace to its source, this quotation from one of your own
official documents. Think of it! And in the meantime you yourselves are
such “easy marks” that you believe them, on their own assertion, to be
the ablest among the Negroes of America. It is not easy to decide which
of the two groups is the bigger joke—you or they.</p>
<p>You have constantly insisted that “there is no race problem, only an
economic problem,” but you will soon be in a fair way to find out
otherwise. Some day you will, perhaps, have learned enough to cease
being “suckers” for perpetual candidates who dickered with the Democrats
up to within a month of “flopping” to your party only because they
“couldn’t make it” elsewhere; some day, perhaps, you will know enough to
put Socialism’s cause in the hands of those who will refrain from using
your party’s organ for purposes of personal pique, spite and venom. When
that day dawns Socialism will have a chance to be heard by Negroes on
its merits. And even now, if you should send anyone up here (black or
white) to put the cause of Karl Marx, freed from admixture of rancor and
hatred of the Negro’s own defensive racial propaganda, you may find that
it will have as good a chance of gaining adherents as any other
political creed. But until you change your tactics or make your
exponents change theirs your case among us will be hopeless indeed.

<h3 id="patronize-your-own.">“Patronize Your Own.”</h3>
<p>The doctrine of “Race First,” although utilized largely by the Negro
business men of Harlem, has never received any large general support
from them. If we remember rightly, it was the direct product of the
out-door and indoor lecturers who flourished in Harlem between 1914 and
1916. Not all who were radical shared this sentiment. For instance, we
remember the debate between Mr. Hubert Harrison, then president of the
Liberty League, and Mr. Chandler Owen, at Palace Casino in December,
1918, in which the “radical” Owen fiercely maintained “that the doctrine
of race first was an indefensible doctrine”; Mr. Harrison maintaining
that it was the source of salvation for the race. Both these gentlemen
have run true to form ever since.</p>
<p>But to return to our thesis. The secondary principle of “patronize
your own,” flowing as it does from the main doctrine of “race first,” is
subject to the risk of being exploited dishonestly—particularly by
business men. And business men in Harlem have shown themselves capable
of doing this all the time. They seem to forget that “do unto others as
you would have them do unto you” is a part of the honest application of
this doctrine. Many of these men seem to want other black people to pay
them for being black. They seem to think that a dirty place and
imperfect service and 3 cents more a pound should be rewarded with
racial patronage regardless of these demerits.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there have grown up in Harlem Negro businesses,
groceries, ice cream parlors, etc., in which the application of prices,
courtesy and selling efficiency are maintained. This is the New Negro
business man, and we say “more power to him.” If this method of applying
the principle should continue to increase in popularity we are sure to
have in Harlem and elsewhere a full and flowing tide of Negro business
enterprises gladly and loyally supported by the mass of Negro purchasers
to their mutual benefit.</p>
<p>The Negro business man who is unintelligently selfish, makes a hash
of racial welfare in the attempt to achieve individual success. A case
in point is that of the brown-skinned dolls. Twenty years ago the Negro
child’s only choice was between a white Caucasian doll and the “nigger
doll.” On the lower levels the one was as cheap as the other. Then, a
step at a time came the picturesque poupee, variously described as the
“Negro doll,” the “colored doll” and the “brown-skinned doll.” This was
sold by white stores at an almost prohibitive price. It was made three
times as easy for the Negro child to idolize a white doll as to idolize
one with the features of its own race. When the principle of “Race
First” began to be proclaimed from scores of platforms and pulpits,
certain Negro business men saw a chance to benefit the race and,
incidently to reap a wonderful harvest of profits, by appealing to a
principle for whose support and maintenance, here and elsewhere, they
had never paid a cent. “Factories” for the production of brown-skinned
dolls began to spring up—most of the factoring consisting of receiving
these dolls from white factories and either stuffing them with saw dust,
excelsior or other filling, or merely changing them from one wrapper to
another. Bear in mind that the proclaimed object was to make it easier
for the Negro mother to teach race patriotism to her Negro child. Yet it
was soon notorious that these leeches were charging $3, $4 and $5 for
Negro dolls which could sell at prices ranging from 75 cents to $1.25,
and yet leave a handsome margin of profit.</p>
<p>The result is that today even in Negro Harlem nine out of ten Negro
children are forced to play with white dolls, because rapacious
scoundrels have been capitalizing the principle of “patronize your own”
in a one-sided way. By lowering their prices to a reasonable level, they
could extend their business tremendously. Failing to do this, they are
playing into the hands of the vendors of white dolls and making it much
easier for the Negro mother to select a white doll for her child;
limiting at once their own market and restricting the development of a
larger racial ideal.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-women-of-our-race">The Women of Our Race</h3>
<p>America owes much to the foreigner and the Negro in America owes even
more. For it was the white foreigner who first proclaimed that the only
music which America had produced that was worthy of the name was Negro
music. It naturally took some time for this truth to sink in, and, in
the meantime, the younger element of Negroes, in their weird worship of
everything that was white, neglected and despised their own race-music.
More than one college class had walked out, highly insulted, when their
white teachers had asked them to sing “Swing Low Sweet Chariot” and “My
Lord, What a Morning.”</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that they now know better. But the real subject of
this editorial is not Negro music, but Negro women. If any foreigner
should come here from Europe, Asia or Africa and be privileged to pass
in review the various kinds of women who live in our America he would
pick out as the superior of them all—the Negro woman. It seems a great
pity that it should be left to the foreigner to “discover” the
Negro-American woman. For her own mankind have been seeing her for
centuries. And yet, outside of the vague rhetoric of the brethren in
church and lodge when they want her to turn their functions into
financial successes, and outside of Paul Dunbar and perhaps two other
poets, no proper amount of esthetic appreciation of her has been
forthcoming from their side.</p>
<p>Consider the facts of the case. The white women of America are
charming to look at-in the upper social classes. But even the Negro
laundress, cook or elevator-girl far surpasses her mistress in the
matter of feminine charms. No white woman has a color as beautiful as
the dark browns, light-browns, peach-browns, or gold and bronze of the
Negro girl. These are some of the things which make a walk through any
Negro section of New York or Washington such a feast of delight.</p>
<p>Then, there is the matter of form. The bodies and limbs of our Negro
women are, on the whole, better built and better shaped than those of
any other women on earth—except perhaps, the Egyptian women’s. And their
gait and movement would require an artist to properly describe. The
grace of their carriage is inimitable.</p>
<p>But their most striking characteristic is a feature which even the
crude mind of mere man can appreciate. It is, to quote “Gunga Din,” “the
way in which they carry their clothes.” They dress well—not merely in
the sense that their clothing is costly and good to look at; but in that
higher sense in which the Parisian woman is the best-dressed woman in
Europe. From shoes and stockings to shirtwaists and hats, they choose
their clothes with fine taste and show them off to the best advantage
when they put them on. That is why a man may walk down the avenue with a
Negro cook or factory girl without anyone’s being able to guess that she
has to work for a living. And, finally, in the matter of that
indefinable something which, for want of a better word, we call simply
“charm”—the Negro women are far ahead of all others in America. They
have more native grace, more winsomeness, greater beauty and more fire
and passion. These facts have already begun to attract attention, here
and elsewhere, and, eventually, the Negro woman will come into her
own.</p>
<p>What say you, brothers! Shall we not love her while she is among us?
Shall we not bend the knee in worship and thank high heaven for the
great good fortune which has given us such sisters and sweethearts,
mothers and wives?</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="to-the-young-men-of-my-race">To the Young Men of My Race</h3>
<p>The Negro is already at work on the problems of reconstruction. He
finds himself in the midst of a world which is changing to its very
foundations. Yet millions of Negroes haven’t now—and have never had—the
slightest knowledge or idea of what those foundations are. How can they
render effective aid to the world without understanding something of how
the world, or society, is arranged, how it runs, and how it is run?</p>
<p>No one, friendly or unfriendly, can deny that the Negroes of America
do wish to help in constructing this world of men and things which will
emerge from the Great War. They want to help, because they realize that
their standing and welfare and happiness in that world will very largely
depend upon what kind of world it is. They have not been happy, so far,
in America—nor, so far as the white man’s rule is concerned,—anywhere
else under it. And they want to be happy, if that be possible. For which
reason they want to help in the re-shaping of the world-to-be.</p>
<p>They feel the burdens put on them by the White Lords of subjection
and repression, of 39 cents worth of education a year in Alabama, of the
deep race hatred of the Christian Church, the Y.M.C.A. and the
Associated Press; of lynching in the land of “liberty,” disfranchisement
in “democratic” America and segregation on the Federal trains and in the
Federal departments. They feel that the world should be set free from
this machinery of mischief-for their sakes as well as that of the
world.</p>
<p>Such is the state of mind of the Negro masses here. And now what does
this attitude of the Negro masses require? GUIDANCE! Guidance, shaping
and direction. Here is strength, here is power, here is a task to call
forth the sublimest heroism on the part of those who should lead them.
And what do we find? No guidance, no shaping of the course for these
millions. The blind may not safely lead the blind in these critical
times—and blind men are practically all that we have as leaders.</p>
<p>The old men whose minds are always retrospecting and reminiscing to
the past, who were “trained” to read a few dry and dead books which they
still fondly believe are hard to get—these do not know anything of the
modern world, its power of change and travel, and the mighty range of
its ideas. Its labor problems and their relation to wars and alliances
and diplomacy are not even suspected by these quaint fossils. They think
that they are “leading” Negro thought, but they could serve us better if
they were cradelled in cotton-wool, wrapped in faded roses, and laid
aside in lavender as mementoes of a dead past.</p>
<p>The young men must gird up their loins for the task of leadership and
leadership has its stern and necessary duties. The first of these is
TRAINING. Not in a night did the call come to Christ, not in a day was
He made fit to make the great sacrifice. It took thirty years of
preparation to fit him for the work of three. Even so, on you, young men
of Negro America, descends the duty of the great preparation. Get
education. Get it not only in school and in college, but in books and
newspapers, in market-places, institutions, and movements. Prepare by
knowing; and never think you know until you have listened to ten others
who know differently—and have survived the shock.</p>
<p>The young man’s second duty is IRREVERENCE. Reverence is in one
sense, respect for what is antiquated because it is antiquated. This
race has lived in a rut too long to reverence the rut. Oldsters love
ruts because they help them to “rub along,” they are easy to understand;
they require the minimum of exertion and brains, and they give the
maximum of ease. Young man! If you wish to be spiritually alert and
alive; to get the very best out of yourself—shun a rut as you would shun
the plague! Never bow the knee to Baal because Baal is in power; never
respect wrong and injustice because they are enshrined in “the sacred
institutions of our glorious land”; never have patience with either
Cowardice or Stupidity because they happen to wear venerable whiskers.
Read, reason, and think on all sides of all subjects. Don’t compare
yourself with the runner behind you on the road; always compare yourself
with the one ahead; so only will you go faster and farther. And set it
before you, as a sacred duty always to surpass the teachers that taught
you—and this is the essence of irreverence.</p>
<p>The last great duty is COURAGE. Dear man of my people, if all else
should fail you, never let <em>that</em> fail. Much as you need
preparation and prevision you are more in need of Courage. This has
been, and is yet, A DOWNTRODDEN RACE. Do you know what a down-trodden
race needs most? If you are not sure, take down your Bible and read the
whole story of Gideon and his band. You will then understand that, as
Dunbar, says:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>A people under the heels of oppression has more need of heroic souls
than one for whom the world is bright. It was in Egypt and in the
wilderness that Israel had need of Moses, Aaron and Joshua. No race
situated like ours, has any place of leadership for those who lack
courage, fortitude, heroism. You may have to turn your eyes away from
the fleshpots of Egypt; you may be called on to fight with wild beasts
at Ephesus; you may have to face starvation in the wilderness or
crucifixion on Calvary. Have the courage to do that which the occasion
demands when it comes. And I make you no promise that “in the end you
will win a glorious crown.” You may fail, fall and be forgotten. What of
it? When you think of our heroic dead on Messines Ridge, along the Aisne
and at Chateau Thierry—how does your heart act? It thrills! It thrills

<h2 id="chapter-vii.our-international-consciousness.">CHAPTER
VII.<BR>OUR INTERNATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS.</h2>
<p>[The ideas expressed in the title of this chapter were formulated as
early as 1915 when I was in the unique position of being the black
leader and lecturer of a white lecture forum, organized by white
liberals, radicals and others at the old Lenox Casino, at 116th
St. &amp; Lenox Ave., New York City. What white people in general
thought of the value of my services at this forum can be read in a
letter written by a white southerner and appearing in the New York Globe
of December 15, 1920. After the closing of this lecture forum the same
explanation of the racial significance of the whole process of the war
was expressed in other lectures given to white people at a lecture forum
which I maintained in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn. I make these
explanations here because I value somewhat the point of priority in the
face of Mr. Lothrop Stoddard’s remarkable book, “The Rising Tide of
Color Against White World-Supremacy” and the sweeping tide of racial
consciousness which found expression subsequently in those Negro
newspapers and magazines which have been called radical.]</p>
<h3 id="the-white-war-and-the-colored-world">The White War and the
Colored World</h3>
<p>The newspapers which we read every day inform us that the world is at
war. Searching the pages of the statisticians, we find that the world is
made up of 17 hundred million people of which 12 hundred million are
colored—black and brown and yellow. This vast majority is at peace and
remains at peace until the white minority determines otherwise. The war
in Europe is a war of the white race wherein the stakes of conflict are
the titles to possession of the lands and destinies of this colored
majority in Asia, Africa and the islands of the sea.</p>
<p>There can be no doubt that the white race as it exists today, is the
superior race of the world. And it is superior, not because it has
better manners more religion or a higher culture; these things are
metaphysical and subject to dispute. The white race rests its claim to
superiority on the frankly materialistic ground that it has the guns,
soldiers, the money and resources to keep it in the position of the
top-dog and to make its will go. This is what white men mean by
civilization, disguise it how they may. This struggle is a conflict of
wills and interests among the various nations which make up the white
race, to determine whose will shall be accepted as the collective will
of the white race; to decide, at least for this century, who shall be
the inheritors of the lands of Africa and Asia and dictators of the
lives and destinies of their colored inhabitants.</p>
<p>The peculiar feature of the conflict is that the white race in its
fratricidal strife is burning up, eating up, consuming and destroying
these very resources of ships, guns, men and money upon which its
superiority is built. They are bent upon this form of self-destruction
and nothing that we can say will stop them.</p>
<p>As representatives of one of the races constituting the colored
majority of the world, we deplore the agony and blood-shed; but we find
consolation in the hope that when this white world shall have been
washed clean by its baptism of blood, the white race will be less able
to thrust the strong hand of its sovereign will down the throats of the
other races. We look for a free India and an independent Egypt; <em>for
nationalities in Africa flying their own flags and dictating their own
internal and foreign policies.</em> This is what we understand by
“making the world safe for democracy.” Anything less than this will fail
to establish “peace on earth and good will toward men.” For the majority
races cannot be eternally coerced into accepting the sovereignty of the
white race. They are willing to live in a world which is the equal
possession of all peoples—white, black, brown and yellow. If the white
race is willing, they will live at peace with it. But if it insists that
freedom, democracy and equality are to exist only for white men, then,
there will be such bloodshed later as this world has never seen. And
there is no certainty that in such a conflict the white race will come
out on top. Not the destinies of the world, but the destinies of the
white race are in the hands of the white race. —1917.</p>

<h3 id="u-need-a-biscuit">U-Need-a Biscuit</h3>
<p>There is one advertisement which appears in the magazines, on the
streets and bill boards which has always seemed to us a masterly
illustration of the principle of repetition. When going to work in the
morning we look up from our daily newspaper and see the flaring sign
which states that U-need-a Biscuit, we may ignore its appeal the first
time, but as the days go by the constant insistence reaches our inner
consciousness and we decide that perhaps after all we do need a biscuit.
At any rate, whenever we have biscuits to buy it is natural that the
biscuit which has been most persistently advertised should recur at once
to our minds and that we should uy that particular biscuit.</p>
<p>We beg to call the above apologue to the attention of the white
people of this country who guide the ship of state either in the halls
of Congress or through the columns of the white newspapers. They are
seemingly at a loss to account for the new spirit which has come over
the Negro people in the Western world. Some pretend to believe that it
is Bolshevism—whatever that may be. Others tell us that it is the
product of alien agitators, and yet others are coming to the front with
the novel explanation that it springs from a desire to mingle our blood
with that of the white people.</p>
<p>Perhaps we are wasting our time in offering an explanation to the
white men of this country. It has been proven again and again that the
Anglo-Saxon is such a professional liar that with the plain truth before
his eyes he will still profess to be seeing something else. Nevertheless
we make the attempt because we believe that a double benefit may accrue
to us thereby. Does any reader who lived through the years from 1914 to
1919 and is still living remember what “Democracy” was? It was the
U-need-a Biscuit advertised by Messrs. Woodrow Wilson, Lloyd George,
Georges Clemenceau and thousands of perspiring publicists, preachers and
thinkers, who were on one side of a conflict then raging in Europe.</p>
<p>Now, you cannot get men to go out and get killed by telling them
plainly that you who are sending them want to get the other fellow’s
land, trade and wealth, and you are too cowardly or too intelligent to
go yourself and risk getting shot over the acquisition. That would never
do. So you whoop it up with any catchword which will serve as sufficient
bait for the silly fools whom you keep silly in order that you may
always use them in this way. “Democracy” was such a catch-word, and the
honorable gentlemen to whom we referred above advertised it for all it
was worth—to them. But, just as we prophesied in 1915, there was an
unavoidable flare-back. When you advertise U-need-a Biscuit incessantly
people will want it; and when you advertise democracy incessantly the
people to whom you trumpet forth its deliciousness are likely to believe
you, take you at your word, and, later on, demand that you make good and
furnish them with the article for which you yourself have created the
appetite.</p>
<p>Now, we Negroes, Egyptians and Hindus, under the pressure of
democracy’s commercial drummers, have developed a democratic complex
which in its turbulent insistence is apt to trouble the firms for whom
these drummers drummed. Because they haven’t any of the goods which they
advertised in the first place, and, in the second place, they haven’t
the slightest intention of passing any of it on—even if they had.</p>
<p>So, gentlemen, when you read of the Mullah, of Said Zagloul Pasha and
Marcus Garvey or Casely Hayford; when you hear of Egyptian and Indian
nationalist uprisings, of Black Star Lines and West Indian
“seditions”—kindly remember (because we know) that these fruits spring
from the seeds of your own sowing. You have said to us “U need a
biscuit,” and, after long listening to you, we have replied, “We do!”
Perhaps next time—if there is a next time—you will think twice before
you furnish to “inferior” peoples such a stick as “democracy” has proved
for the bludgeoning of your heads. In any case your work has been too
well done for even you to obliterate it. The Negro of the Western world
can truthfully say to the white man and the Anglo-Saxon in particular,
“You made me what I am today, I hope you’re satisfied.” And if the white
man isn’t satisfied—well, we should worry. That’s all. —July, 1920.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="our-larger-duty">Our Larger Duty</h3>
<p>The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the Color
Line. But what is the Color Line? It is the practice of the theory that
the colored and “weaker” races of the earth shall not be free to follow
“their own way of life and of allegiance,” but shall live, work and be
governed after such fashion as the dominant white race may decide.
Consider for a moment the full meaning of this fact. Of the seventeen
hundred million people that dwell on our earth today more than twelve
hundred million are colored—black and brown and yellow. The so-called
white race is, of course, the superior race. That is to say, it is on
top by virtue of its control of the physical force of the worldships,
guns, soldiers, money and other resources. By virtue of this control
England rules and robs India, Egypt, Africa and the West Indies; by
virtue of this control we of the United States can tell Haytians,
Hawaiians and Filipinos how much they shall get for their labor and what
shall be done in their lands; by virtue of this control Belgium can
still say to the Congolese whether they shall have their hands hacked
off or their eyes gouged out—and all without any reference to what
Africans, Asiatics or other inferior members of the world’s majority may
want.</p>
<p>It is thus clear that, as long as the Color Line exists, all the
perfumed protestations of Democracy on the part of the white race must
be simply downright lying. The cant of “Democracy” is intended as dust
in the eyes of white voters, incense on the altar of their own
self-love. It furnishes bait for the clever statesmen who hold the
destinies of their people in their hands when they go fishing for
suckers in the waters of public discussion. But it becomes more and more
apparent that Hindus, Egyptians, Africans, Chinese and Haytians have
taken the measure of this cant and hypocrisy. And, whatever the white
world may think, it will have these peoples to deal with during this
twentieth century.</p>
<p>In dealing with them in the past it has been considered sufficient
that the white man should listen to his own voice alone in determining
what colored peoples should have; and he has, therefore, been trying
perpetually to “solve” the problems arising from his own assumption of
the role of God. The first and still the simplest method was to kill
them off, either by slaughter pure and simple, as in the case of the
American Indians and the Congo natives, or by forcibly changing their
mode of life, as was done by those pious prudes who killed off the
Tasmanians; or by importing among them rum, gin, whiskey and
consumption, as has been attempted in the case of the Negroes of Africa
and North America. But, unlike the red Indians and Tasmanians, most of
these subject peoples have refused to be killed off. Their vitality is
too strong.</p>
<p>The second method divides itself into internal and external
treatment. The internal treatment consists in making them work, to
develop the resources of their ancestral lands, not for themselves, but
for their white overlords, so that the national and imperial coffers may
be filled to overflowing, while the Hindu ryot, on six cents a day,
lives down to the level of the imperialist formula:</p>
<div class="poetry">

</div>
<div class="verse">

</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The external treatment consists of girdling them with forts and
battleships and holding armies in readiness to fly at their throats upon
the least sign of “uppishness” or “impudence.”</p>
<p>Now, this similarity of suffering on the part of colored folk has
given, and is giving, rise to a certain similarity of sentiment. Egypt
has produced the Young Egypt movement; India, the Swadesha, the
All-India Congress, and the present revolutionary movement which has lit
the fuse of the powder-keg on which Britain sits in India today; Africa
has her Ethiopian Movement which ranges from the Zulus and Hottentots of
the Cape to the Ekoi of Nigeria; in short, the darker races, chafing
under the domination of the alien whites, are everywhere showing a
disposition to take Democracy at its word and to win some measure of it
for themselves.</p>
<p>What part in this great drama of the future are the Negroes of the
Western world to play? The answer is on the knees of the gods, who often
make hash of the predictions of men. But it is safe to say that, before
the Negroes of the Western world can play any effective part they must
first acquaint themselves with what is taking place in that larger world
whose millions are in motion. They must keep well informed of the trend
of that motion and of its range and possibilities. If our problem here
is really a part of a great world-wide problem, we must make our
attempts to solve our part link up with the attempts being made
elsewhere to solve the other parts. So will we profit by a wider
experience and perhaps be able to lend some assistance to that ancient
Mother Land of ours to whom we may fittingly apply the words of
Milton:</p>
<p>“Methinks I see in my mind a mighty and puissant nation, rousing
herself like a strong man after sleep and shaking her invincible locks;
methinks I see her like an eagle mewing her mighty youth and kindling
her undazzled eyes at the full noon-day beam; methinks I see her scaling
and improving her sight at the fountain itself of heavenly radiance,
while the whole noise of timorous and flocking birds—with them also that
love the twilight—hover around, amazed at what she means, and in their
useless gabble would prognosticate a year of sects and schisms.” —The
New Negro, August, 1919.</p>

<h3 id="help-wanted-for-hayti">Help Wanted for Hayti</h3>
<p>While we were at war our President declared, over and over again,
that we were calling upon the flower of our manhood to go to France and
make itself into manure in order that the world might be made safe for
democracy. Today the deluded people of the earth realize that the accent
is on the “moc(k).” Ireland, India and Egypt are living proofs that the
world has been lied to. We need not bite our tongues about it. Those who
told us that the world would be made safe for democracy have lied to us.
All over the world men and women are finding out that when an American
President, a British Premier or a French “tiger” speaks of “the world,”
he does not include the black and brow: and yellow millions, who make up
the vast majority of the earth’s population. And now the sheeted ghost
of a black republic rises above the tomb where its bones lie buried and
points its silent but accusing finger at American democracy. What can we
answer in the case of Hayti? British India and Ireland, Turkish Armenia
or Russian Poland have never presented such ruthless savagery as has
been let loose in Hayti in a private war for which President Wilson has
never had the consent of Congress. The white daily papers speak
complacently of the repulse of “bandits.” What is this but a developing
disease of the American conscience, to put the blinkers of a catchword
over the eyes of the spirit?</p>
<p>The people of Hayti are being shot, sabred and bombed, while
resisting an illegal invasion of their homes, and, if public decency is
not dead in America white and black men and women will insist that
Congress investigate this American Ireland.</p>
<p>When Ireland feels the pressure of the English heel, the Irish in
America make their voices heard and help to line up American public
opinion on their side. When Paderewski’s government massacres Jews in
Poland, the Jews of America raise money, organize committees, put the U.
S. Government on the job—and get results. But when Negroes are
massacred—not in Africa, but in Hayti, under American control—what do we
American Negroes do? So far, nothing. But that inaction will not last.
Negroes must write their Congressmen and Senators concerning the
atrocity perpetrated at Port au Prince last week. They should organize
committees to go before Congress and put the pitiful facts, demanding
investigation, redress and punishment.</p>
<p>For as long as such things can be done without effective protest or
redress, black people every where will refuse to believe that the
democracy advertised by lying white politicians can be anything but a
ghastly joke.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Meanwhile the feet of civilized slayers have woven across the fair
face of the earth a crimson mesh of murder and rapine. The smoke of
blazing villages ascends in lurid holocaust to the bloody god of battles
from the altar of human hate in the obscene temple of race
prejudice.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words, which we wrote in 1912, come back to our mind eight
years later with no abatement of the awful horror which they express.
And what gives a special point to them at this moment is the bloody rape
of the republics of Hayti and Santo Domingo which is being perpetrated
by the bayonets of American sailors and marines, with the silent and
shameful acquiescence of 12,000,000 American Negroes too cowardly to
lift a voice in effective protest or too ignorant of political affairs
to know what is taking place. What boots it that we strike heroic
attitudes and talk grandiloquently of Ethiopia stretching forth her
hands when we Africans of the dispersion can let the land of L’Ouverture
lie like a fallen flower beneath the feet of swine?</p>
<p>The facts of the present situation in that hapless land are given in
the current issue of <em>The Nation</em> (a white American weekly).
Taken together with the accounts which we have printed from time to
time, it tells a tale of shuddering horror in comparison with which the
Putumayo pales into insignificance and the Congo atrocities of Belgium
are tame. The two West Indian republics have been murderously assaulted;
their citizens have been shot down by armed ruffians, bombed by
aeroplanes, hunted into concentration camps and there starved to death.
In their own land their civil liberties have been taken away, their
governments have been blackjacked and their property stolen. And all
this by the “cracker” statesmanship of “the South,” without one word of
protest from that defunct department, the Congress of the United
States!</p>
<p>The Constitution of the United States says that the power to declare
war shall belong exclusively to the Congress of the United States. But
the Congress of the United States has been shamelessly ignored. In
furtherance of the God-given “cracker” mandate to “keep the nigger in
his place,” a mere Secretary of the Navy has assumed over the head of
Congress the right to conquer and annex two nations and to establish on
their shores the “cracker-democracy” of his native Carolina
slave-runs.</p>
<p>It is high time that the Negro people of the United States call the
hand of Josephus Daniels by appealing to the Legislature of the United
States to resume its political functions, investigate this high-handed
outrage nd impeach the Secretary of the Navy of high crimes and
misdemeanors against the peace and good name of the United States. The
ordinary excuse of cowards will not obtain in this case. We would not be
violating any law—wartime or other—but, on the contrary, we should be
striving to put an end to a flagrant violation of the Constitution
itself on the part of a high officer, who took an oath to maintain,
support and defend it. This is our right and our duty. Irishmen, on
behalf of Ireland, sell the bonds of an Irish loan to free Ireland from
the tyranny of Britain—with whom we are on friendly terms—on the very
steps of New York’s City Hall, while we black people are not manly
enough to get up even a petition on behalf of our brothers in Hayti.</p>
<p>Out upon such crawling cowardice! Rouse, ye slaves, and show that the
spirit of liberty is not quite dead among you! You who elected
“delegates” to go to a Peace Conference to which you had neither
passport nor invitation, on behalf of bleeding Africa, get together and
present a monster petition to the American Congress, over which you have
some control. Remember that George the Third engaged in a contest with
these colonies because he had trouble at home. He could not defeat the
Pitts, Burkes and Foxes at home, and wanted to win prestige from the
colonials. Had he succeeded in setting his foot on their necks he would
have returned home with increased prestige and power to bend the free
spirits of</p>
<p>England to his will. Pitt knew this, and so did Fox and Burke. That
is why they took the side of their distant cousins against the British
king. And the British liberals of today thank their memories for it. If
the “crackers” of the South can fasten their yoke on the necks of our
brothers overseas, then God help us Negroes in America in the years to
come!</p>
<p>If we were now appealing directly to the white men of America we
might dwell upon the moral aspects of the question. But we must leave
that to others. Yet we cannot do so without recalling the words of a
great poet:</p>

<p>And we draw some slight consolation from the fact that, even if he
should escape impeachment, Josephus Daniels must surrender up his “brief

<h3 id="when-might-makes-right">When Might Makes Right</h3>
<p>A correspondent whose letter appears elsewhere raises the question of
the relation between mental competence and property rights. “Does
inability to govern destroy title to ownership?” he asks. The white race
assumes an affirmative answer in every case in which the national
property of darker and weaker races are concerned and deny it in cases
in which their own national property interests are involved. It seems
strange that whereas the disturbances occurring in our own southern
states are never considered sufficient to justify the destruction of
their sovereignty, on the other hand, such disturbances occurring in
Hayti or Mexico are considered a sufficient reason for invasion and
conquest by white Americans. The same is true of England, France and
Italy. A disturbance in Alexandria, Delhi, Ashanti or the Cameroons
suffices to fix upon those territories and cities the badge of
inferiority and incompetence to rule themselves. The conclusion is
always drawn in such cases that the white race has been called by this
fortunate combination of circumstances to do the ruling for them. But
similar disturbances occurring in Wales, Essen or Marseilles would never
be considered as sufficient to justify the dictatorship of foreign
powers in the interest of “law and order.”</p>
<p>The truth is that “might makes right” in all these cases. White
statesmen, however, often deny this at the very moment when they are
using “force without stint, force to the utmost” to establish “rights”
which they claim over territories, peoples, commerce and the high seas.
Their characteristic hypocrisy keeps them from telling the truth as
plainly as Von Bernhardi did in his now famous book, “Germany and the
Next War.” The “sociological” reason for this hypocrisy is the fact that
they need to preach “goodness,” “right” and “justice” to those over whom
they rule in order that their ruling may be made easy by the consequent
good behavior of the ruled. But they themselves, however good, must
practice ruthlessness, injustice and the rule of the strong hand to make
their governance go. It is this fact which causes intelligent Negroes,
Filipinos, Chinese and Egyptians to spurn with contempt the claims which
Caucasian diplomats, statesmen, writers and missionaries make on behalf
of their moral superiority. They lie; they know that they lie, and now
they’re beginning to know that we know it also. This knowledge on our
part is a loss of prestige for them, and our actions in the future,
based upon this knowledge, must needs mean a loss of power for them.
Which is, after all, the essential fact.</p>

<h3 id="bolshevism-in-barbados">Bolshevism in Barbados</h3>
<p>Among the newspapers in Barbados there is a charming old lady by the
name of the <em>Barbados Standard</em>. From time to time this faded
creature gets worried about the signs of awakening observable in those
Negroes who happen to be living in the twentieth century. Then she
shakes and shivers, throws a few fits, froths at the mouth, and,
spasmodically flapping her arms, yells to all and sundry that there is
“Bolshevism among Negroes.”</p>
<p>Recently this stupid old thing and its congeners have discovered
evidences of a Bolshevist R–r–r–revolution in Trinidad, and,
presumptively, all over the British West Indies. Now the specter which
these fools fear is nothing but the shadow cast by the dark body of
their own system of stiff-necked pride, stark stupidity and stubborn
injustice whenever the sun of civic righteousness rises above the
horizon of sloth and ignorance. But, like fools afraid of their own
shadows, they point at the thing for which they alone are responsible
and shriek for salvation.</p>
<p>We shouldn’t care to suggest to them that to lie down and die would
be one good way to avoid these fearful shadows, because we see the
possibility of another way. Let them resolve that they will cease making
a lie of every promise of liberty, democracy and self-determination that
they frantically made from 1914 to 1919. Let the white Englishman learn
that justice exists not only for white Englishmen, but for all men. Let
him get off the black man’s back, stand out of the black man’s light,
play the game as it should be played, and he will find very little need
for wasting tons of print paper and thousands of pounds in a crusade
against the specter of Bolshevism.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="a-new-international">A New International</h3>
<p>In the eyes of our overlords internationalism is a thing of varying
value. When Mr. Morgan wants to float a French or British loan in the
United States; when Messrs. Wilson, Clemenceau, Lloyd George and Orlando
want to stabilize their joint credit and commerce; when areas like the
Belgian Congo are to be handed over to certain rulers without the
consent of their inhabitants—then the paans of praise go up to the god
of “internationalism” in the temple of “civilization.” But when any
portion of the world’s disinherited (whether white or black) seeks to
join hands with other groups in the same condition, then the lords of
misrule denounce the idea of internationalism as anarchy, sedition,
Bolshevism and disruptive propaganda.</p>
<p>Why the difference? It is because the international linking up of
peoples is a source of strength to those who are linked up. Naturally,
the overlords want to strengthen themselves. And, quite as naturally,
they wish to keep their subject masses from strengthening themselves in
the same way. Today the great world-majority, made up of black, brown
and yellow peoples, are stretching out their hands to each other and
developing a “consciousness of kind”—as Professor Giddings would call
it. They are seeking to establish their own centers of diffusion for
their own internationalism, and this fact is giving nightmares to
Downing street, the Quai d’Orsay and other centers of white capitalist
internationalism.</p>
<p>The object of the capitalist international is to unify and
standardize the exploitation of black, brown and yellow peoples in such
a way that the danger to the exploiting groups of cutting each other’s
throats over the spoils may be reduced to a minimum. Hence the various
agreements, mandates and spheres of influence. Hence the League of
Nations, which is notoriously not a league of the white masses, but of
their gold-braided governors. Faced by such a tendency on the part of
those who bear the white man’s burden for what they can get out of it,
the darker peoples of the world have begun to realize that their first
duty is to themselves. A similarity of suffering is producing in them a
similarity of sentiment, and the temper of that sentiment is not to be
mistaken.</p>
<p>To the white statesmen “civilization” is identical with their own
overlordship, with their right and power to dictate to the darker
millions what their way of life and of allegiance shall be. To this the
aroused sentiment of the world’s darker majority demurs. They want to be
as free as England, America or France. They do not wish to be “wards of
the nations” of Europe any longer. And the problem for the white
statesmen of the future will be to square democracy with the subjection
of this dark majority. Can they achieve either horn of this dilemma? Can
they effect a junction of the two?</p>
<p>Frankly, we doubt it. Continued suppression may be fraught with
consequences disastrous to white overlordship. In any case the tendency
toward an international of the darker races cannot be set back.
Increasing enlightenment, the spread of technical science, and the
recently acquired knowledge of the weak points of white “civilization”
gained by the darker peoples during the recent World War, are enough to
negative such a supposition. The darker peoples will strive increasingly
for their share of sunlight, and if this is what white “civilization”
opposes, then white “civilization” is likely to have a hard time of
it.</p>

<h3 id="the-rising-tide-of-color">The Rising Tide of Color</h3>
<p>Mr. William Randolph Hearst, the ablest white publicist in America,
has broken loose, and, in a recent editorial in the New York
<em>American</em>, has absolutely endorsed every word of the warning
recently issued by Lothrop Stoddard in his book, “The Rising Tide of
Color.” In justice to Mr. Hearst, it must be pointed out (as we
ourselves did in 1916) that he saw this handwriting on the wall long
ago. Mr. Hearst is not particularly famous as a friend of the darker
races; but one must give him credit for having seen what was involved in
the war between the white nations of Europe and America. As far back as
1915, the present writer was engaged in pointing out to white people
that the racial aspect of the war in Europe was easily the most
important, despite the fact that no American paper, not even
Mr. Hearst’s, would present that side of the matter for the
consideration of its readers. Now, however, they are beginning to wake
up—as people generally do when disaster is upon them—frantically with
much screaming and flapping of arms. But, in such cases, the doom
approaching is but the ripened result of deeds that have been done, and
is, therefore, absolutely inescapable.</p>
<p>The white race has lied and strutted its way to greatness and
prominence over the corpses of other peoples. It has capitalized,
christianized, and made respectable, “scientific,” and “natural,” the
fact of its dominion. It has read back into history the race relations
of today, striving to make the point that previous to its advent on the
stage of human history, there was no civilization or culture worthy of
the name. And with minatory finger it admonishes us that if it were to
pass off the stage as the controlling factor in the World’s destiny,
there would be no civilization or culture remaining. Naturally, we take
exception to both these views, because, for the past, we know better
and, for the future, we think better of the many peoples who make up the
cycle of civilization.</p>
<p>But these conditions are not the gravest at present. The fact of most
tremendous import is that the white race in trying to settle its own
quarrels has called in black, brown and yellow to do its fighting for
it, with the result that black, brown and yellow will learn thereby how
to fight for themselves, even against those whom they were called in to
assist. The white race cannot escape from its dilemma, however. If it
were to decree hereafter that wars between whites should be restricted
to whites alone, then we should be given the poignant spectacle of the
white race continuing to cut its own throat while the increasing masses
of black, brown and yellow remained unaffected by that process, “It is
to laugh,” as the cynical gods would say. Or, to use a trite
Americanism, it is, “heads I win, tails you lose.” It is thumbs down for
the white race in the world’s arena, and they are to be the dealers of
their own death blow. Such are the consequences of conquest!</p>
<p>The analogies between the present situation of the white race and the
situation of the Roman Empire in the fourth century of the Christian era
are too many and striking to be easily ignored. Now, as then, we have
“barbarians” and “super-men.” Now, as then, the super-men are such in
their own estimation. Now, as then, they have, as they fondly think, a
monopoly of the money power, brain power and political power of the
world. Now, as then, the necessities of their own selfishness and greed,
constrain and compel them to share their education and their culture
with the races whom they exploit. Now, as then, in the crisis of their
fortunes, they must utilize the knowledge and abilities of these
barbarian folk, and now, as then, this exercising of abilities on behalf
of the overlord develops abilities and ambition at an equal rate; and,
having given the barbarian tiger its first taste of blood, the unleashed
results can not now be restrained.</p>
<p>In the Roman days, as in the days of Charlemagne’s successors, those
who hold the balances generally also wield the sword; and if
<em>their</em> blood and sand determine which among the rulers shall get
the prizes of victory, then these same qualities must needs urge them to
take from such victors-by-proxy so much of the fruits of victory as
their own needs may suggest or their own power maintain. Truly “they
that take the sword shall perish by the sword.”</p>

<h3 id="the-white-war-and-the-colored-races">The White War and the
Colored Races</h3>
<p>[The following article was written in 1918 when the Great War still
raged. It was written for a certain well known radical magazine; but was
found to be “too radical” for publication at that time. It is given now
to the Negro public partly because the underlying explanation which it
offers of the root-cause of the war has not yet received treatment (even
among socialistic radicals) and partly because recent events in China,
India, Africa and the United States have proved the accuracy of its
forecasts.]</p>
<p>—</p>
<p>The Nineteenth Christian Century saw the international expansion of
capitalism—the economic system of the white peoples of Western Europe
and America-and its establishment by force and fraud over the lands of
the colored races, black and brown and yellow. The opening years of the
Twentieth Century present us with the sorry spectacle of these same
white nations cutting each other’s throats to determine which of them
shall enjoy the property which has been acquired. For this is the real
sum and substance of the original “war aims” of the belligerents;
although in conformity with Christian cunning, this is one which is
never frankly avowed. Instead, we are fed with the information that they
are fighting for “Kultur” and “on behalf of small nationalities.” Let us
look carefully at this camouflage.</p>
<h4 id="the-sham-of-democracy">The Sham of “Democracy”</h4>
<p>In the first place, we in America need not leave our own land to seek
reasons for suspecting the sincerity of democratic professions. While we
are waging war to establish democracy three thousand miles away,
millions of Negroes are disfranchised in our own land by the “cracker”
democracies of the Southern States which are more intent upon making
slaves of their black fellow-citizens than upon rescuing the French and
Belgians from the similar brutalities of the German Junkers. The
horrible holocaust of East St. Louis was possible only in three modern
States—Russia of the Romanoffs, Turkey and the United States—and it ill
becomes any one of them to point a critical finger at the others.</p>
<p>But East St. Louis was simply the climax of a long series of
butcheries perpetrated on defenseless Negroes which has made the murder
rate of Christian America higher than that of heathen Africa and of
every other civilized land. And, although our government can order the
execution of thirteen Negro soldiers for resenting the wholesale insults
to the uniform of the United States and defending their lives from
civilian aggressors, not one of the murderers of black men, women and
children has been executed or even ferreted out. Nor has our war
Congress seen fit as yet to make lynching a Federal crime. What wonder
that the Negro masses are insisting that before they can be expected to
enthuse over the vague formula of making the world “safe for democracy”
they must receive some assurance that their corner of the world—the
South—shall first be made “safe for democracy!” Who knows but that
perhaps the situation and treatment of the American Negro by our own
government and people may have kept the Central Powers from believing
that we meant to fight for democracy in Europe, and caused them to
persist in a course which has driven us into this war in which we must
spend billions of treasure and rivers of blood.</p>
<p>It should seem, then, that “democracy,” like “Kultur,” is more
valuable as a battle-cry than as a real belief to be practised by those
who profess it. And the plea of “small nationalities” is estopped by
three facts: Ireland, Greece and Egypt, whose Khedive, Abbas Hilmi, was
tumbled off his throne for failing to enthuse over the claims of
“civilization” as expounded by Lord Grey.</p>
<h4 id="sir-harry-johnston-speaks">Sir Harry Johnston Speaks</h4>
<p>But this is merely disproof. The average American citizen needs some
positive proof of the assertion that this war is being waged to
determine who shall dictate the destinies of the darker peoples and
enjoy the usufruct of their labor and their lands. For the average
American citizen is blandly ignorant of the major facts of history and
has to be told. For his benefit I present the following statement from
Sir Harry Johnston, in “The Sphere” of London. Sir Harry Johnston is the
foremost English authority on Africa and is in a position to know
something of imperial aims.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Rightly governed, I venture to predict that Africa will, if we are
victorious, repay us and all our allies the cost of our struggle with
Germany and Austria. The war, deny it who may, was really fought over
African questions. The Germans wished, as the chief gain of victory, to
wrest rich Morocco from French control, to take the French Congo from
France, and the Portuguese Congo from Portugal, to secure from Belgium
the richest and most extensive tract of alluvial goldfield as yet
discovered. This is an auriferous region which, properly developed,
will, when war is over, repay the hardest hit of our allies (France) all
that she has lost from the German devastation of her home lands. The
mineral wealth of trans-Zambezian Africa—freed forever, we will hope,
from the German menacemis gigantic; only slightly exploited so far.
Wealth is hidden amid the seemingly unprofitable deserts of the Sahara,
Nubia, Somaliland and Namaqua. Africa, I predict, will eventually show
itself to be the most richly endowed of all the continents in valuable
vegetable and mineral substances.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is the sum and substance of what Schopenhauer would have called
“the sufficient reason” for this war. No word of “democracy” there, but
instead the easy assumption that, as a matter of course, the lands of
black Africa belong to white Europe and must be apportioned on the good
old principle:—</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse leadingquote">
“… the simple plan,
</div>
<div class="verse">
That he shall take who has the power,
</div>
<div class="verse">
And he must keep who can.”
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h4 id="the-economics-of-war">The Economics of War</h4>
<p>It is the same economic motive that has been back of every modern war
since the merchant and trading classes secured control of the powers of
the modern state from the battle of Plassy to the present world war.
This is the natural and inevitable effect of the capitalist system, of
what (for want of a worse name) we call “Christendom.” For that system
is based upon the wage relationship between those who own and those who
operate the gigantic forces of land and machinery. Under this system no
capitalist employs a worker for two dollars a day unless that worker
creates more than two dollars’ worth of wealth for him. Only out of this
surplus can profits come. If ten million workers should thus create one
hundred million dollars’ worth of wealth each day and get twenty or
fifty millions in wages, it is obvious that they can expend only what
they have received, and that, therefore, every nation whose industrial
system is organized on a capitalist basis must produce a mass of surplus
products over and above, not the need, but the purchasing power of the
nation’s producers. Before these products can return to their owners as
profits they must be sold somewhere. Hence the need for foreign markets,
for fields of exploitation and “spheres of influence” in “undeveloped”
countries whose virgin resources are exploited in their turn after the
capitalist fashion. But, since every industrial nation is seeking the
same outlet for its products, clashes are inevitable and in these
clashes beaks and claws—armies and navies—must come into play. Hence
beaks and claws must be provided beforehand against the day of conflict,
and hence the exploitation of white men in Europe and America becomes
the reason for the exploitation of black and brown and yellow men in
Africa and Asia. And, therefore, it is hypocritical and absurd to
pretend that the capitalist nations can ever intend to abolish wars.
For, as long as black men are exploited by white men in Africa, so long
must white men cut each other’s throats over that exploitation. And
thus, the selfish and ignorant white worker’s destiny is determined by
the hundreds of millions of those whom he calls “niggers.” “The strong
too often think that they have a mortgage upon the weak; but in the
domain of morals it is the other way.”</p>
<h4 id="the-color-line">The Color Line</h4>
<p>But economic motives have always their social side; and this
exploitation of the lands and labor of colored folk expresses itself in
the social theory of white domination; the theory that the worst human
stocks of Montmartre, Seven Dials and the Bowery are superior to the
best human stocks of Rajputana or Khartoum. And when these colored folk
who make up the overwhelming majority of this world demand decent
treatment for themselves, the proponents of this theory accuse them of
seeking social equality. For white folk to insist upon the right to
manage their own ancestral lands, free from the domination of tyrants,
domestic and foreign, is variously described as “democracy” and
“self-determination.” For Negroes, Egyptians and Hindus to seek the same
thing is impudence. What wonder, then, that the white man’s rule is felt
by them to rest upon a seething volcano whose slumbering fires are made
up of the hundreds of millions of Chinese, Japanese, Hindus and
Africans! Truly has it been said that “the problem of the 20th Century
is the problem of the Color Line.” And wars are not likely to end; in
fact, they are likely to be wider and more terrible—so long as this
theory of white domination seeks to hold down the majority of the
world’s people under the iron heel of racial repression.</p>
<p>Of course, no sane person will deny that the white race is, at
present, the superior race of the world. I use the word “superior” in no
cloudy, metaphysical sense, but simply to mean that they are on top and
their will goes—at present. Consider this fact as the pivotal fact of
the war. Then, in the light of it, consider what is happening in Europe
today. The white race is superiorits will goes—because it has invented
and amassed greater means for the subjugation of nature and of man than
any other race. It is the top dog by virtue of its soldiers, guns,
ships, money, resources and brains. Yet there in Europe it is
deliberately burning up, consuming and destroying these very soldiers,
guns, ships, money, resources and brains, the very things upon which its
supremacy rests. When this war is over, it will be less able to enforce
its sovereign will upon the darker races of the worid. Does any one
believe that it will be as easy to hold down Egypt and India and Persia
after the war as it was before? Hardly.</p>
<h4 id="the-racial-results-of-the-war">The Racial Results of the
War</h4>
<p>Not only will the white race be depleted in numbers, but its quality,
physical and mental, will be considerably lowered for a time. War
destroys first the strongest and bravest, the best stocks, the young men
who were to father the next generation, The next generation must,
consequently, be fathered by the weaker stocks of the race. And thus, in
physical stamina and in brain-power, they will be less equal to the task
of holding down the darker millions of the world than their fathers
were. This was the thought back of Mr. Hearst’s objection to our
entering the war.</p>
<p>He wanted the United States to stand as the white race’s reserve of
man-power when Europe had been bled white. But what will be the effect
of all this upon that colored majority whose preponderant existence our
newspapers ignore? In the first place, it will feel the lifting of the
pressure as the iron hand of “discipline” is relaxed. And it will
expand, when that pressure is removed, to the point where it will first
ask, then demand, and finally secure, the right of self-determination.
It will insist that, not only the white world, but the whole world, be
made “safe for democracy.” This will mean a self-governing Egypt, a
self-governing India, and independent African states as large as Germany
and France—and larger. And, as a result, there will come a shifting of
the basis of international politics and business and of international
control. This is the living thought that comes to me from the newspapers
and books that have been written and published by colored men in Africa
and Asia during the past three years. It is what I have heard from their
own lips as I have talked with them. And, yet, of this thought which is
inflaming the international underworld, not a word appears in the
parochial press of America, which seems to think that if it can keep its
own Negroes down to servile lip-service, it need not face the world-wide
problem of the “Conflict of Color,” as Mr, Putnam-Weale calls it.</p>
<p>But that the more intelligent portions of the white world are
becoming distressingly conscious of it, is evident from the first great
manifesto of the Russian Bolsheviki last year when they asked about
Britain’s subject peoples.</p>
<p>And the British workingmen have evidently done some thinking in their
turn. In their latest declarations they seem to see the ultimate
necessity of compelling their own aristocrats to forego such imperial
aspirations as that of Sir Harry Johnston, and of extending the
principle of self-determination even to the black people of Africa. But
eyes which have for centuries been behind the blinkers of race prejudice
cannot but blink and water when compelled to face the full sunlight. And
Britain’s workers insist that “No one will maintain that the Africans
are fit for self-government.” And on the same principle (of excluding
the opinion of those who are most vitally concerned) Britain’s ruling
class may tell them that “No one maintains that the laboring classes of
Britain are fit for self-government.” But their half-hearted demand that
an international committee shall take over the British, German, French
and Portuguese possessions in Africa and manage them as independent
nationalities(?) until they can “go it alone,” would suggest that their
eyesight is improving.</p>
<p>To sum it all up, the war in Europe is the result of the desire of
the white governments of Europe to exploit for their own benefit the
lands and labor of the darker races, and, as the war continues, it must
decrease the white man’s stock of ability to do this successfully
against the wishes of the inhabitants of those lands. This will result
in their freedom from thralldom and the extension of political, social,
and industrial democracy to the twelve hundred million black and brown
and yellow peoples of the world. This, I take it, is what President
Wilson had in mind when he wished to make the world “safe for
democracy.” But, whether I am mistaken or not, it is the idea which
dominates today the thought of those darker millions.</p>

VIII.<br>EDUCATION AND THE RACE.</h2>
<p>[With most of the present sources of power controlled by the white
race it behooves my race as well as the other subject races to learn the
wisdom of the weak and to develop to the fullest that organ whereby
weakness has been able to overcome strength; namely, the intellect. It
is not with our teeth that we will tear the white man out of our
ancestral land. It isn’t with our jaws that we can ring from his hard
hands consideration and respect. It must be done by the upper and not by
the lower parts of our heads. Therefore, I have insisted ever since my
entry into the arena of racial discussion that we Negroes must take to
reading, study and the development of intelligence as we have never done
before. In this respect we must pattern ourselves after the Japanese who
have gone to school to Europe but have never used Europe’s education to
make them the apes of Europe’s culture. They have absorbed, adopted,
transformed and utilized, and we Negroes must do the same. The three
editorials in this chapter and the article which follows them were
written to indicate from time to time the duty of the transplanted
African in this respect.]</p>
<h3 id="reading-for-knowledge">Reading for Knowledge</h3>
<p>Some time ago we wrote an editorial entitled “Read, Read, Read!” We
touch upon the same subject again, because in our recent trip to
Washington we found thousands of people who are eager to get in touch
with the stored-up knowledge which the books contain, but do not know
just where to turn for it. In New York the same situation obtains, and
no help is afforded by the papers of our race.</p>
<p>The reason is that some of our newspaper editors don’t read and don’t
know beans themselves. James W. Johnson is one of the notable
exceptions. We were cheered up a good deal by noting his recent
editorial advice to our “leaders” to read Arthur Henderson’s “The Aims
of Labor.” But that was six months after the editor of <em>The
Voice</em> had been telling thousands of the “led” all about it and
about the British Labor Party and the Russian Bolsheviki in his outdoor
talks in Harlem.</p>
<p>But there is no doubt that the New Negro is producing a New
Leadership and that this new leadership will be based not upon the
ignorance of the masses, but upon their intelligence. The old leadership
was possible partly because the masses were ignorant. Today the masses
include educated laymen who have studied science, theology, history and
economics, not, perhaps in college but, nevertheless, deeply and down to
date. These young men and women are not going to follow fools and,
indeed, are not going to follow any one, blindly. They want a reason for
the things that they are asked to do and to respect. The others, the
so-called Common People, are beginning to read and understand. As we sat
in the great John Wesley A.M.E. Zion Church in Washington one Sunday
night, and heard the cultured black minister speak to his people on
literature, science, history and sociology, and yet so simply that even
the dullest could catch the meat and inspiration of his great ideas, we
could not help saying as we went out of the church: “Depend upon it,
these people will demand as much from their next minister.” In fact our
race will demand as much from all its leaders. And they will demand no
less for themselves.</p>
<p>So, with a glad heart, we reprint the following paragraphs from our
earlier editorial trusting that our readers everywhere may find them
helpful:</p>
<p>As a people our bent for books is not encouraging. We mostly read
trash. And this is true not only of our rank and file but even of our
leaders. When we heard Kelly Miller address the Sunrise Club of New York
at a Broadway hotel two or three years ago, we were shocked at the
ignorance of modern science and modern thought which his remarks
displayed. His biology was of the brand of Pliny who lived about
eighteen hundred years ago. For him Darwin and Spencer and Jacques Loeb
had never existed nor written. His ignorance of the A.B.C.’s of
astronomy and geology was pitiful. If this is true of the leaders to
whom our reading masses look, what can we expect from those reading
masses? The masses must be taught to love good books. But to love them
they must first know them. The handicaps placed on us in America are too
great to allow us to ignore the help which we can get from that
education which we get out of school for ourselves—the only one that is
really worth while.</p>
<p>Without the New Knowledge the New Negro is no better than the old.
And this new knowledge will be found in the books. Therefore, it would
be well if every Negro of the new model were to make up his (or her)
mind to get the essentials of modern science and modern thought as they
are set down in the books which may be easily had. Don’t talk about
Darwin and Spencer: read them!</p>
<p>To help the good work along we append the following list of books
that are essential. When you <em>master</em> these you will have a
better “education” than is found in nine-tenths of the graduates of the
average American college.</p>
<p>“Modern Science and Modern Thought,” by Samuel Laing; “The Origin of
Species” and “The Descent of Man,” by Charles Darwin; “The Principles of
Sociology” and “First Principles,” by Herbert Spencer; “The Childhood of
the World” and “The Childhood of Religion,” by Edward Clodd;
“Anthropology,” by E. B. Tylor (very easy to read and a work of standard
information on Races, Culture and the origins of Religion, Art and
Science); Buckle’s “History of Civilization”; Gibbon’s “Decline and Fall
of the Roman Empire”; “The Martyrdom of Man,” by Winwood Reade; the
books on Africa by Livingstone and Mungo Park, and “The Mind of
Primitive Man,” by Franz Boas. —Sept., 1918.</p>

<h3 id="education-and-the-race">Education and the Race</h3>
<p>In the dark days of Russia, when the iron heel of Czarist despotism
was heaviest on the necks of the people, those who wished to rule
decreed that the people should remain ignorant. Loyalty to interests
that were opposed to theirs was the prevailing public sentiment of the
masses. In vain did the pioneers of freedom for the masses perish under
the knout and the rigors of Siberia. They sacrificed to move the masses,
but the masses, strong in their love of liberty, lacked the head to
guide the moving feet to any successful issue. It was then that Leo
Tolstoi and the other intelligentsia began to carry knowledge to the
masses. Not only in the province of Tula, but in every large city, young
men of university experience would assemble in secret classes of
instruction, teaching them to read, to write, to know, to think and to
love knowledge. Most of this work was underground at first. But it took.
Thousands of educated persons gave themselves to this work-without pay:
their only hope of reward lay in the future effectiveness of an
instructed mass movement.</p>
<p>What were the results? As knowledge spread, enthusiasm was backed by
brains. The Russian revolution began to be sure of itself. The
workingmen of the cities studied the thing that they were “up against,”
gauged their own weakness and strength as well as their opponents’. The
despotism of the Czar could not provoke them to a mass movement before
they were ready and had the means; and when at last they moved, they
swept not only the Czar’s regime but the whole exploiting system upon
which it stood into utter oblivion.</p>
<p>What does this mean to the Negro of the Western world? It may mean
much, or little: that depends on him. If other men’s experiences have
value for the New Negro Manhood Movement it will seek now to profit by
them and to bottom the new fervor of faith in itself with the solid
support of knowledge. The chains snap from the limbs of the young giant
as he rises, stretches himself, and sits up to take notice. But let him,
for his future’s sake, insist on taking notice. To drop the figure of
speech, we Negroes who have shown our <em>manhood</em> must back it by
our <em>mind</em>. This world, at present, is a white man’s world—even
in Africa. We, being what we are, want to shake loose the chains of his
control from our corner of it. We must either accept his domination and
our inferiority, or we must contend against it. But we go up to win; and
whether we carry on that contest with ballots, bullets or business, we
can not win from the white man unless we know at least as much as the
white man knows. For, after all, knowledge <em>is</em> power.</p>
<p>But that isn’t all. What kind of knowledge is it that enables white
men to rule black men’s lands? Is it the knowledge of Hebrew and Greek,
philosophy or literature? It isn’t. It is the knowledge of explosives
and deadly compounds: that is chemistry. It is the knowledge which can
build ships, bridges, railroads and factories: that is engineering. It
is the knowledge which harnesses the visible and invisible forces of the
earth and air and water: that is science, modern science. And that is
what the New Negro must enlist upon his side. Let us, like the Japanese,
become a race of knowledge-getters, preserving our racial soul, but
digesting into it all that we can glean or grasp, so that when Israel
goes up out of bondage he will be “skilled in all the learning of the
Egyptians” and competent to control his destiny.</p>
<p>Those who have knowledge must come down from their Sinais and give it
to the common people. Theirs is the great duty to simplify and make
clear, to light the lamps of knowledge that the eyes of their race may
see; that the feet of their people may not stumble. This is the task of
the Talented Tenth.</p>
<p>To the masses of our people we say: Read! Get the reading habit;
spend your spare time not so much in training the feet to dance, as in
training the head to think. And, at the very outset, draw the line
between books of opinion and books of information. Saturate your minds
with the latter and you will be forming your own opinions, which will be
worth ten times more to you than the opinions of the greatest minds on
earth. Go to school whenever you can. If you can’t go in the day, go at
night. But remember always that the best college is that on your
bookshelf: the best education is that on the inside of your own head.
For in this work-a-day world people ask first, not “Where were you
educated?” but “What do you know?” and next, “What can you do with it?”
And if we of the Negro race can master modern knowledge—the kind that
counts—we will be able to win for ourselves the priceless gifts of
freedom and power, and we will be able to hold them against the
world.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-racial-roots-of-culture">The Racial Roots of Culture</h3>
<p>Education is the name which we give to that process by which the
ripened generation brings to bear upon the rising generation the
stored-up knowledge and experience of the past and present generations
to fit it for the business of life. If we are not to waste money and
energy, our educational systems should shape our youth for what we
intend them to become.</p>
<p>We Negroes, in a world in which we are the under dog, must shape our
youth for living in such a world. Shall we shape them mentally to accept
the status of under-dog as their predestined lot? Or shall we shape them
into men and women fit for a free world? To do the former needs nothing
more than continuing as we are. To do the latter is to shape their souls
for continued conflict with a theory and practice in which most of the
white world that surrounds them are at one.</p>
<p>The educational system in the United States and the West Indies was
shaped by white people for white youth, and from their point of view, it
fits their purpose well. Into this system came the children of Negro
parents when chattel slavery was ended—and their relation to the
problems of life was obviously different. The white boy and girl draw
exclusively from the stored-up knowledge and experience of the past and
present generations of white people to fit them for the business of
being dominant whites in a world full of colored folk. The examples of
valor and virtue on which their minds are fed are exclusively white
examples. What wonder, then, that each generation comes to maturity with
the idea imbedded in its mind that only white men are valorous and fit
to rule and only white women are virtuous and entitled to chivalry,
respect and protection? What wonder that they think, almost
instinctively, that the Negro’s proper place, nationally and
internationally, is that of an inferior? It is only what we should
naturally expect.</p>
<p>But what seems to escape attention is the fact that the Negro boy and
girl, getting the same (though worse) instruction, also get from it the
same notion of the Negro’s place and part in life which the white
children get. Is it any wonder, then, that they so readily accept the
status of inferiors; that they tend to disparage themselves, and think
themselves worth while only to the extent to which they look and act and
think like the whites? They know nothing of the stored-up knowledge and
experience of the past and present generations of Negroes in their
ancestral lands, and conclude there is no such store of knowledge and
experience. They readily accept the assumption that Negroes have never
been anything but slaves and that they never had a glorious past as
other fallen peoples like the Greeks and Persians have. And this despite
the mass of collected testimony in the works of Barth, Schweinfurth,
Mary Kingsley, Lady Lugard, Morel, Ludolphus, Blyden, Ellis, Ratzel,
Kidd, Es-Saadi, Casely Hayford and a host of others, Negro and
white.</p>
<p>A large part of the blame for this deplorable condition must be put
upon the Negro colleges like Howard, Fisk, Livingstone and Lincoln in
the United States, and Codrington, Harrison and the Mico in the West
Indies. These are the institutions in which our cultural ideals and
educational systems are fashioned for the shaping of the minds of the
future generations of Negroes. It cannot be expected that it shall begin
with the common schools; for, in spite of logic, educational ideas and
ideals spread from above downwards. If we are ever to enter into the
confraternity of colored peoples it should seem the duty of our Negro
colleges to drop their silly smatterings of “little Latin and less
Greek” and establish modern courses in Hausa and Arabic, for these are
the living languages of millions of our brethern in modern Africa.
Courses in Negro history and the culture of West African peoples, at
least, should be given in every college that claims to be an institution
of learning for Negroes. Surely an institution of learning for Negroes
should not fail to be also an institution of Negro learning. —The New
Negro, Sept. 1919.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="the-new-knowledge-for-the-new-negro">The New Knowledge for the
New Negro</h3>
<p>Quite a good deal of unnecessary dispute has been going on these days
among the guardians of the inner temple as to just which form of worship
is necessary at the shrine of the Goddess Knowledge. In plain English,
the pundits seem to be at odds in regard to the kind of education which
the Negro should have. Of course, it has long been known that the
educational experts of white America were at odds with ours on the same
subject; now, however, ours seem to be at odds among themselves.</p>
<p>The essence of the present conflict is not the easy distinction
between “lower” and “higher” education, which really has no meaning in
terms of educational principles, but it is rather “the knowledge of
things” versus “the knowledge of words.” The same conflict has been
waged in England from the days of Huxley’s youth to the later nineties
when the London Board Schools were recognized and set the present
standard of efficiency for the rest of England. The present form of the
question is, “Shall education consist of Latin and Greek, literature and
metaphysics, r of modern science, modern languages and modern thought?”
The real essence of the question is whether we shall train our children
to grapple effectively with the problem of life that lies before them,
or to look longingly back upon the past standards of life and thought
and consider themselves a special class because of this.</p>
<p>If education be, as we assert, a training for life, it must of course
have its roots in the past. But so has the art of the blacksmith, the
tailor, the carpenter, the bookbinder or the priest. What the
classicists really seek is the domination of the form, method and aim of
that training by the form, methods and aims of an earlier age.</p>
<h4 id="classics-clerics-and-class-culture">Classics, Clerics and Class
Culture</h4>
<p>Perhaps an explanation of that earlier training may serve to give the
real innerness of the classicists’ position so that ordinary people may
understand it better than the classicists themselves seem to do. In the
Middle Ages, the schools of Western Europe and the subject matter of the
education given in them were based upon the Latin “disciplines.” Western
Europe had no literature, no learning, no science of its own. It was the
church—particularly the monasteries—to which men had to go to get such
training as was obtainable in a barbarous age. This training was, of
course, given in the tongue of the church which was Latin, the clerical
language. The contact of medieval Europeans with the dark-skinned Arabs
added Greek and the knowledge of Greek literature and philosophy to the
earlier medieval discipline. Imbedded in this was the substance of
science nurtured by the Arabs and added to by them.</p>
<p>The ruling classes kept their children within the treadmill of these
two literatures and languages and it came to be thought that this was
the indispensable training for a gentleman. But:—</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza" lang="la">
<div class="verse leadingquote">
<em>“Tempora mutantur, nos et mutamur in illis.”</em>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>**</p>
<p>We are in a different age, an age in which the nation, not the
church, gives training to all children, and not merely to the children
of aristocrats who will grow up to do nothing. The children of the
people must become the doers of all that is done in the world of
tomorrow, and they must be trained for this doing. Today in England, not
Oxford, the home of lost ideals, but such institutions as the University
of London, are the sources of that training which gives England its
physicians, surgeons, inventors, business men and artists.</p>
<h4 id="classicists-ignorant-of-latin-and-greek">Classicists Ignorant of
Latin and Greek</h4>
<p>But the noise of the classicists may be rudely stopped by merely
pointing out the hollowness of their watch words. These persons would
have us believe that Latin and Greek are, in their eyes, the backbone of
any education that is worth while. Very well then, let us take them at
their word. I make the broad assertion that not one in one thousand of
them can read a page of Greek or Latin that may be set before them. I
offer to put under their noses a page of Athenaeus or Horace (to say
nothing of more important classical authors) and if they should be able
to read and translate it at sight I shall be genuinely surprised. Let
the common reader who is a man of today make the test with this little
bit of Latin verse:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza" lang="la">
<div class="verse leadingquote">
<em>“Exegi momentum acre perennius</em>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<em>Regalique situ pyramidum altius.”</em>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Let him ask some classicist to translate off-hand this common school
boy’s tag from a most popular author and note whether they can place the
author or translate the lines. Here is another:</p>
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza" lang="la">
<div class="verse">
<em>Per varios casus, per tot discrimina rerum,</em>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<em>Tendimus in Latium.</em>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>To speak in plain United States, when it comes to the showdown it
will be found that those of us who argue in favor of the modern
discipline (in so far as we have any knowledge of classical literature)
know more about them than those whose sole defence they are.</p>
<p>It is said by the classicists that a knowledge of Latin and Greek is
necessary to an adequate comprehension of the English language. But so
is the knowledge of Sanscrit, Arabic, French and Italian. And when it
comes to facility and clearness of expression, it will be found that
Huxley’s prose is superior to that of Matthew Arnold, and Brisbane’s
superior to that of any professor of the Latin language in Harvard or
Yale. So much for the ghost fighters. Requiescant in pace!</p>
<h4 id="the-knowledge-we-need">The Knowledge We Need</h4>
<p>Now, what is the knowledge which the New Negro needs most? He needs
above all else a knowledge of the wider world and of the long past. But
that is history, modern and ancient: History as written by Herodotus and
John Bach McMaster; sociology not as conceived by Giddings, but as
presented by Spencer and Ward, and anthropology as worked out by Boas
and Thomas. The Negro needs also the knowledge of the best thought; but
that is literature as conceived, not as a collection of flowers from the
tree of life, but as its garnered fruit. And, finally, the Negro needs a
knowledge of his own kind, concerning which we shall have something to
say later, And the purposes of this knowledge? They are, to know our
place in the human processus, to strengthen our minds by contact with
the best and most useful thought-products evolved during the long rise
of man from anthropoid to scientist; to inspire our souls and to lift
our race industrially, commercially, intellectually to the level of the
best that there is in the world about us. For <em>never until the
Negro’s knowledge of nitrates and engineering, of chemistry and
agriculture, of history, science and business is on a level, at least,
with that of the whites, will the Negro be able to measure arms
successfully with them.</em></p>

<h3 id="the-negro-in-history-and-civilization">The Negro in History and
Civilization</h3>
<p class="reviewedauthor">
(From Superman to Man, by J. A. Rogers.)
</p>
<p>This volume by Mr. Rogers is the greatest little book on the Negro
that we remember to have read. It makes no great parade of being
“scientific,” as so many of our young writers do who seem to think that
science consists solely in logical analysis. If science consists
fundamentally of facts, of information and of principles derived from
those facts, then the volume before us is one of the most scientific
that has been produced by a Negro writer. It sweeps the circle of all
the social sciences. History, sociology, anthropology, psychology,
economics and politics—even theology—are laid under contribution and
yield a store of information which is worked up into a presentation so
plain and clear that the simplest can read and understand it, and yet so
fortified by proofs from the greatest standard authorities of the past
and present that there is no joint in its armor in which the keenest
spear of a white scientist may enter.</p>
<p>Unlike an older type of scholar (now almost extinct) the author does
not go to vapid verbal philosophers or devotional dreamers for the facts
of history and ethnology. He goes to historians and ethnologists for
them and to anthropologists for his anthropology. The result is
information which stands the searching tests of any inquirer who chooses
to doubt and investigate before accepting what is set before him.</p>
<p>From this book the unlearned reader of the African race can gather
proof that his race has not always been a subject or inferior race. He
has the authority of Professor Reisner, of Harvard; of Felix Dubois,
Volney, Herodotus, Finot, Sergi, the modern Egyptologists and the
scholars of the white world who assembled at the Universal Races
Congress in London in 1911, for the belief that his race has founded
great civilizations, has ruled over areas as large as all Europe, and
was prolific in statesmen, scientists, poets, conquerors, religious and
political leaders, arts and crafts, industry and commerce when the white
race was wallowing in barbarism or sunk in savagery. Here he can learn
on good authority, from St. Jerome and Cicero, Herodotus and Homer down
to the modern students of race history, that cannibalism has been a
practise among white populations like the Scythians, Scots and Britons;
that the white races have been slaves; that here in America the slavery
of white men was a fact as late as the 19th century, and “according to
Professor Cigrand, Grover Cleveland’s grandfather, Richard Falley, was
an Irish slave in Connecticut.” In short, he will learn here, not that
newspaper science which keeps even “educated” Americans so complacently
ignorant, but the science of the scientists themselves. He will learn
all that this kind of science has to tell of the relative capacity and
standing of the black and white races—and much of it will surprise him.
But all of it will please and instruct.</p>
<p>The book also deals with the facts of the present position of the
Negro in America and the West Indies; with questions of religion,
education, politics and political parties, war work, lynching,
miscegenation on both sides, the beauty of Negro women and race
prejudice. And on everyone of these topics it gives a minimum of opinion
and a maximum of information. This information flows forth during the
course of a series of discussions between an educated Negro Pullman
porter and a Southern white statesman on a train running between Chicago
and San Francisco. The superior urbanity of the Negro, coupled with his
wider information and higher intelligence, eventually wins over the
Caucasian to admit that the whole mental attitude of himself and his
race in regard to the Negro was wrong and based on nothing better than
prejudice.</p>
<p>This conversational device gives the author an opportunity to present
all the conflicting views on both sides of the Color Line, and the
result is a wealth of information which makes this book a necessity on
the bookshelf of everyone, Negro or Caucasian, who has some use for
knowledge on the subject of the Negro. The book is published by the
author at 4700 State Street, Chicago.</p>
<h3 id="darkwater">“Darkwater”</h3>
<p class="reviewedauthor">
By W. E. B. Du Bois.
</p>
<p>An unwritten law has existed for a long time to the effect that the
critical estimates which fix the status of a book by a Negro author
shall be written by white men. Praise or blame—. the elementary
criticism which expresses only the reviewer’s feelings in reference to
the book—has generally been the sole function of the Negro critic. And
the results have not been good. For, in the first place, white critics
(except in music) have been too prone to judge the product of a Negro
author as Dr. Johnson judged the dancing dog: “It isn’t at all like
dancing; but then, one shouldn’t expect more from a dog.” That is why
many Negro poets of fifth grade merit are able to marshal ecomiums by
the bushel from friendly white critics who ought to know better. On the
other hand, there is the danger of disparagement arising solely from
racial prejudice and the Caucasian refusal to take Negro literary
products seriously.</p>
<p>In either case the work fails to secure consideration solely on its
merits. Wherefore, it is high time that competent appraisal of Negro
books should come from “our side of the street.” But, then, the Negro
reading public should be taught what to expect, viz., that criticism is
neither “knocking” nor “boosting”; but an attempt, in the first place,
to furnish a correct and adequate idea of the scope and literary method
of the book under review, of the author’s success in realizing his
objects, and of the spirit in which he does his work. In the second
place, the critic should be expected to bring his own understanding of
the subject matter of the book to bear upon the problem of enlightening
the readers’ understanding, that at the end the reader may decide
whether the work is worth his particular while.</p>
<p>This book of Dr. Du Bois’ is one which challenges the swing of
seasoned judgment and appraisal. It challenges also free thinking and
plain speaking. For, at the very outset, find ourselves forced to demur
to the publishers’ assumptions as to its author’s status. “Even more
than the late Booker Washington, Mr. Du Bois is now chief spokesman of
the two hundred million men and women of African blood.” So say the
publishers—or the author. But this is outrageously untrue. Once upon a
time Dr. Du Bois held a sort of spiritual primacy among The Talented
Tenth, not at all comparable to that of Booker Washington in scope, but
vital and compelling for all that. The power of that leadership,
however, instead of increasing since Mr. Washington’s death, has
decreased, and is now openly flouted by the most active and outspoken
members of The Talented Tenth in Negro America. And, outside of the
twelve or fifteen millions “of African blood” in the United States, the
mass of that race in South and West Africa, Egypt and the Philippines
know, unfortunately, very little of Dr. Du Bois. It may be, however,
that this is merely a publishers’ rhodomontade.</p>
<p>And it is the publishers themselves who challenge for this volume a
comparison with “The Souls of Black Folk,” which was published by
McClurg in 1903. It is regrettable that they should force the issue, for
“The Souls of Black Folk” is a greater book than “Darkwater” in many
ways. In the first place, its high standard of craftsmanship is
maintained through every chapter and page. There are no fag-ends, as in
the chapter “Of Beauty and Death” in the present volume, where the
rhetoric bogs down, the author loses the thread of his purpose and goes
spieling off into space, spinning a series of incongruous purple patches
whose tawdry glitter shows the same reversion to crude barbarism in
taste which leads a Florida fieldhand to don opal-colored trousers, a
pink tie, pari-colored shirt and yellow shoes. Artistically, that
chapter is an awful thing, and I trust that the author is artist enough
to be ashamed of it.</p>
<p>And, though it may savor of anti-climax, “The Souls of Black Folk”
was more artistically “gotten” up—to use the grammar of its author.
“Darkwater” is cheaply bound and cheaply printed on paper which is
almost down to the level of the Seaside Library. Neither in mechanical
nor mental quality does the book of 1920 come up to the level of that of
1903.</p>
<p>Yet, in spite of some defects, “Darkwater” (with the exception of
chapters six, seven, eight and nine) is a book well worth reading. It is
a collection of papers written at different times, between 1908 and
1920, and strung loosely on the string of race. One wishes that the
author could have included his earlier essay on The Talented Tenth and
his address on the aims and ideals of modern education, delivered some
twelve years ago to the colored school children of Washington, D. C.</p>
<p>Each paper makes a separate chapter, and each chapter is followed by
a rhetorical sprig of symbolism in prose or verse in which the
tone-color of the preceding piece is made manifest to the reader. Of
these tone-poems in prose and verse, the best are the Credo; A Litany at
Atlanta; The Riddle of the Sphinx, and Jesus Christ in Texas. In these
the lyrical quality of the author’s prose is lifted to high levels. In
these elegance does not slop over into turgid declamation and rhetorical
claptrap—which has become a common fault of the author’s recent prose as
shown in The Crisis. In this, the first part of the book, the work is
genuine and its rhetoric rings true. Nevertheless, the sustained
artistic swing of “The Souls of Black Folk,” which placed that work (as
a matter of form and style) on the level of Edgar Saltus’ <em>Imperial
Purple</em>—this is not attained in “Darkwater.”</p>
<p>The book may be said to deal largely with the broad international
aspects of the problem of the color line and its reactions on
statecraft, welt-politik, international peace and international trade,
industry, education and the brotherhood of man. Each chapter, or paper,
is devoted to one of these reactions. Then there is a charming
autobiographical paper, “The Shadow of Years,” which first appeared in
The Crisis about three years ago, in which we have the study of a soul
by itself. The growth of the author’s mind under the bewildering shadow
cast by the color line is tragically set forth. I say tragically with
deliberation; for what we see here, despite its fine disguise, is the
smoldering resentment of a mulatto who finds the beckoning white doors
of the world barred on his approach. One senses the thought that, if
they had remained open, the gifted spirit would have entered and made
his home within them. <em>Mais, chacun a son gout</em>, and no one has
the right to quarrel with the author on that doubtful score.</p>
<p>In the chapter on “The Souls of White Folk” we have a fine piece, not
so much of analysis, as of exposition. The author puts his best into it.
And yet that best seems to have failed to bite with acid brutality into
the essential iron of the white man’s soul. For the basic elements of
that soul are Hypocrisy, Greed and Cruelty. True, the author brings this
out; but he doesn’t burn it in. The indictment is presented in terms of
an appeal to shocked sensibilities and a moral sense which exists, for
the white man, only in print; whereas it might have been made in other
terms which come nearer to his self-love. Nevertheless it is
unanswerable in its logic.</p>
<p>In “The Hands of Ethiopia,” as in “The Souls of White Folk,” we catch
the stern note of that threat which (disguise it as our journals will),
the colored races are making, of an ultimate appeal in terms of color
and race to the white man’s only God—the God of Armed Force. But the
author never reaches the height of that newer thought—an international
alliance of Black, Brown and Yellow against the arrogance of White.</p>
<p>In “Work and Wealth” and “The Servant in the House” the problems of
work and its reward, and the tragedy of that reward, are grippingly set
forth in relation to the Negro in America and in the civilized world.
“The Ruling of Men” is followed by three papers of very inferior merit
and the book ends with a fantastic short story, “The Comet” which, like
“The Coming of John” in “The Souls of Black Folk,” suggests that Dr. Du
Bois could be a compelling writer of this shorter form of fiction. The
touch in this story of incident is light, but arresting.</p>
<p>Dr. Du Bois, in the looseness of phrase current in our time in
America, is called a scholar—on what grounds we are not informed. But
Dr. Du Bois is not a scholar; his claim to consideration rests upon a
different basis, but one no less high. And when the Negro culture of the
next century shall assay the products of our own it will seem remarkable
that this supreme wizard of words, this splendid literary artist, should
have left his own demesne to claim the crown of scholarship. Surely,
there is honest credit enough in being what he is, our foremost man of
culture. And this “Darkwater,” despite its lapses from artistic grace,
helps to rivet his claim to that consideration. It is a book which will
well repay reading.</p>
<h3 id="the-rising-tide-of-color-against-white-world-supremacy">The
Rising Tide of Color Against White World Supremacy</h3>
<p class="reviewedauthor">
By Lothrop Stoddard
</p>
<p>About ten years ago Mr. B. L. Putnam Weale in “The Conflict of Color”
tried to open the eyes of the white men of the world to the fact that
they were acting as their own grave diggers. About the same time
Mr. Melville E. Stone, president of the Associated Press, in an address
before the Quill Club on “Race Prejudice in the Far East” reinforced the
same grisly truth. Five years later “T. Shirby Hodge” wrote “The White
Man’s Burden: A Satirical Forecast,” and ended it with these pregnant
words: “The white man’s burden is—himself.” His publishers practically
suppressed his book, which, by the way, should have been in the library
of every intelligent Negro. The white world was indisposed then to
listen to its voices of warning. But today the physical, economic and
racial ravages of the World War have so changed the white world’s mind
that within four weeks of its appearance “The Rising Tide of Color
Against White World Supremacy,” by Lothrop Stoddard, has struck the
bull’s-eye of attention and has already become the most widely talked-of
book of the year. White men of power are discussing its facts and its
conclusions with bated breath and considerable disquietude.</p>
<p>Here is a book written by a white man which causes white men to
shiver. For it calls their attention to the writing on the wall. It
proves that the white race in its mad struggle for dominion over others
has been exhausting its vital resources and is exhausting them further.
It proves to the hilt the thesis advanced in 1917 in my brief essay on
“The White War and the Colored Races” that, whereas the white race was
on top by virtue of its guns, ships, money, intellect and massed
man-power, in the World War it was busy burning up, depleting and
destroying these very resources on which its primacy depended. But even
though the white capitalists knew all this their mad greed was still
their master. This great race is still so low spiritually that it sells
even its racial integrity for dollars and cents. Mr. Stoddard’s book may
disturb its sense of security for a brief space, but it cannot keep
white “civilization” from its mad dance of death. “What shall it profit
a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul?” And the white
race will finally find that this is even more true racially than
individually.</p>
<p>We have noticed for many years that whereas domestic journalism was
merely journalism—the passing register of parochial sensations—the
journalism of the international publicists like Lord Bryce, Meredith
Townsend, Archibald Colquhoon, Putnam Weale and Hyndman was something
more solid than journalism. In the writings of these men hard fact and
stark reality are wedded to wide reading and deep thinking. They are the
real social scientists rather than the stay-at-home, cloistered
sociologists who, presuming to know everything, have seen nothing. The
present volume is one of the best of the former and is full of the
qualities of its class. But at the very outset it suffers from the
unwelcome assistance of Dr. Madison Grant, “chairman of the New York
Zoological Society and trustee of the American Museum of Natural
History.” Dr. Grant has accumulated a large stock of musty ethnological
ideas of which he unburdens himself in what he evidently intends as a
“learned” introduction, without which freightage the book would be much
better. The difference in value and accuracy between Mr. Stoddard’s text
and the pseudo-scientific introduction of Dr. Grant would furnish fair
material for philosophic satire. Unfortunately we cannot indulge the
inclination in the columns of a weekly newspaper.</p>
<p>Dr. Grant, in owlish innocence, splutters out the usual futile folly
which (in other domains) has brought the white race to the frontiers of
the present crisis. He reads back into history the racial values of
today and trails the Anglo-Saxon’s crass conceit and arrogance across
the pages of its record, finding “contrast of mental and spiritual
endowments … elusive of definition,” and other racial clap-trap whose
falsity has been demonstrated again and again by warm-hearted
enthusiasts like Jean Finot and coldly critical and scientific scholars
like Dr. Taylor (“Origin of the Aryans”), Sergi (“The Mediterranean
Race”) and J. M. Robertson (“The Evolution of States”). But one can
forgive Dr. Grant; he is a good American, and good Americans (especially
“scientists” on race) are usually fifty years behind the English, who,
in turn, are usually twenty years behind the Germans. Dr. Grant’s
annexation of the past history of human culture to the swollen record of
the whites sounds good—even if it smells bad. And he is in good
Anglo-Saxon company. Sir Harry Johnston does the same thing and gets
titles (scientific and other) by so doing. The Englishman takes the very
Egyptians, Hindus and tribal Liberians, whom he would call “niggers” in
New York and London, and as soon as he finds that they have done
anything worth while he tags them with a “white” tag. Thus, to the
professional “scientist” like Dr. Grant, living in the parochial
atmosphere of the United States, science is something arcane, recondite
and off the earth; while to the American like Mr. Stoddard, who has been
broadened by travel and contact with the wider world, science, is, as it
should be, organized daily knowledge and common sense. Thus journalists,
good and bad, are the ones who form opinion in America, because
“scientists” are so distressingly stupid.</p>
<p>Mr. Stoddard’s thesis starts from the proposition that of the
seventeen hundred million people on our earth today the great majority
is made up of black, brown, red and yellow people. The white race, being
in the minority, still dominates over the lands of black, brown, red and
(in the case of China) has assumed a right of dictatorship and disposal
even in the yellow man’s lands. In the course of this dictatorship and
domination the white race has erected the barrier of the color line to
keep the other races in their place. But this barrier is cracking and
giving way at many points and the flood of racial self-assertion,
hitherto dammed up, threatens to overflow the outer and inner dikes and
sweep away the domination of the whites.</p>
<p>The author approaches his theme with a curiously graduated respect
for other races. This respect, while it is a novelty in the attitude of
the blond overlords, is always in direct proportion to the present power
and discernible potentialities of the races discussed. For the yellow
man of Japan and China he shows the greatest deference. The browns (of
India, Persia, Afghanistan, Egypt and the Mohammedan world in general)
are, of course, inferior, but must be respected for their militancy. The
reds (the original American stock which is the backbone of the
population of Mexico, Central and South America) are a source of
contamination for white blood and an infernal nuisance, capable of
uniting with Japan and China in an onslaught on the land areas reserved
for white exploitation in the western world; while the blacks, at the
foot of the ladder, have never amounted to anything, don’t amount to
anything now, and can never seriously menace the superiority of the
whites.</p>
<p>The gradation is full of meaning, especially to those fervid
theorists who affect to believe that religion, morality, loyalty and
good citizenship constitute a good claim to the white man’s respect. For
it is Japan’s actual military might and China’s impending military might
which have put them in Grade A, while the brown man’s show of resistance
in Egypt, India and elsewhere under Islam, and his general physical
unrest and active discontent have secured for him a classification in
Grade B. The American in Mexico and South America keeps his window open
toward the east; but the black man still seems, in our author’s eyes, to
be the same loyal, gentle, stupid beast of burden that the white man’s
history has known—except in those parts of Africa in which he has
accepted the Mohammedan religion and thus become a part of the potential
terror of the Moslem world. In this we think our author mistaken; but,
after all, it is neither arguments nor logic that will determine these
matters, but deeds and accomplishments.</p>
<p>But, however his racial respect may be apportioned, Mr. Stoddard
holds that his race is doomed. “If the present drift be not changed we
whites are all ultimately doomed. Unless we set our house in order the
doom will sooner or later overtake us all.” The present reviewer stakes
his money on “the doom,” for the white race’s disease is an ingrowing
one whose development. inheres in their very nature. They are so
singularly constituted that they would rather tear themselves to pieces
parading as the lords of creation than see any other people achieve an
equal favor of fortune.</p>
<p>In the pages of this book the author presents many chastening truths
and wide vistas of international politics which are enlightening when
carefully studied. But it is not our intent to cover the entire field of
his work, and we think that we have said enough to indicate the high
value and suggestiveness of the work. But we may be allowed to point out
that all the way through the author, though clear and enlightened,
remains an unreconstructed Anglo-Saxon, desirous of opening the eyes of
his race to the dangers which beset them through their racial injustice
and arrogance; but sternly, resolutely, intent that they shall not share
their overlordship with any other of the sons of earth. His book is
written in a clear and commendable style; he shows but few defects of
temper and a shrewd mastery of his materials. The book should be widely
read by intelligent men of color from Tokio to Tallahassee. It is
published by Charles Scribner’s Sons at $3, and is well worth the
price.</p>
