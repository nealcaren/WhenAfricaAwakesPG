## CHAPTER VII.<BR>OUR INTERNATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS.

[The ideas expressed in the title of this chapter were formulated 
as early as 1915 when I was in the unique position of
being the black leader and lecturer of a white lecture forum,
organized by white liberals, radicals and others at the old
Lenox Casino, at 116th St. & Lenox Ave., New York City.
What white people in general thought of the value of my
services at this forum can be read in a letter written by a
white southerner and appearing in the New York Globe of
December 15, 1920. After the closing of this lecture forum the
same explanation of the racial significance of the whole process 
of the war was expressed in other lectures given to white
people at a lecture forum which I maintained in the Brownsville 
section of Brooklyn. I make these explanations here
because I value somewhat the point of priority in the face
of Mr. Lothrop Stoddard’s remarkable book, “The Rising
Tide of Color Against White World-Supremacy” and the
sweeping tide of racial consciousness which found expression
subsequently in those Negro newspapers and magazines which
have been called radical.]


### The White War and the Colored World

The newspapers which we read every day inform us
that the world is at war. Searching the pages of the
statisticians, we find that the world is made up of 17 hundred 
million people of which 12 hundred million are 
colored&mdash;black and brown and yellow. This vast majority is
at peace and remains at peace until the white minority 
determines otherwise. The war in Europe is a war of the
white race wherein the stakes of conflict are the titles to
possession of the lands and destinies of this colored majority 
in Asia, Africa and the islands of the sea.

There can be no doubt that the white race as it exists
today, is the superior race of the world. And it is superior, 
not because it has better manners more religion
or a higher culture; these things are metaphysical and
subject to dispute. The white race rests its claim to
superiority on the frankly materialistic ground that it has
the guns, soldiers, the money and resources to keep it
in the position of the top-dog and to make its will go.
This is what white men mean by civilization, disguise it
how they may. This struggle is a conflict of wills and 
interests among the various nations which make up the
white race, to determine whose will shall be accepted as
the collective will of the white race; to decide, at least for
this century, who shall be the inheritors of the lands of
Africa and Asia and dictators of the lives and destinies
of their colored inhabitants.

The peculiar feature of the conflict is that the white
race in its fratricidal strife is burning up, eating up, 
consuming and destroying these very resources of ships,
guns, men and money upon which its superiority is built.
They are bent upon this form of self-destruction and
nothing that we can say will stop them.

As representatives of one of the races constituting the
colored majority of the world, we deplore the agony and
blood-shed; but we find consolation in the hope that when
this white world shall have been washed clean by its
baptism of blood, the white race will be less able to thrust
the strong hand of its sovereign will down the throats of
the other races. We look for a free India and an independent 
Egypt; *for nationalities in Africa flying their own
flags and dictating their own internal and foreign policies.*
This is what  we understand by “making the
world safe for democracy.” Anything less than this will
fail to establish “peace on earth and good will toward
men.” For the majority races cannot be eternally coerced
into accepting the sovereignty of the white race. They
are willing to live in a world which is the equal possession
of all peoples&mdash;white, black, brown and yellow. If the
white race is willing, they will live at peace with it. But
if it insists that freedom, democracy and equality are to
exist only for white men, then, there will be such bloodshed 
later as this world has never seen. And there is no
certainty that in such a conflict the white race will come
out on top. Not the destinies of the world, but the destinies 
of the white race are in the hands of the white race. &mdash;1917.

### U-Need-a Biscuit 

There is one advertisement which appears in the magazines, 
on the streets and bill boards which has always
seemed to us a masterly illustration of the principle of
repetition. When going to work in the morning we look
up from our daily newspaper and see the flaring sign
which states that U-need-a Biscuit, we may ignore its
appeal the first time, but as the days go by the constant
insistence reaches our inner consciousness and we decide
that perhaps after all we do need a biscuit. At any rate,
whenever we have biscuits to buy it is natural that the
biscuit which has been most persistently advertised should
recur at once to our minds and that we should uy that
particular biscuit.

We beg to call the above apologue to the attention of
the white people of this country who guide the ship of
state either in the halls of Congress or through the
columns of the white newspapers. They are seemingly at
a loss to account for the new spirit which has come over
the Negro people in the Western world. Some pretend
to believe that it is Bolshevism&mdash;whatever that may be.
Others tell us that it is the product of alien agitators, and
yet others are coming to the front with the novel 
explanation that it springs from a desire to mingle our
blood with that of the white people.

Perhaps we are wasting our time in offering an explanation 
to the white men of this country. It has been
proven again and again that the Anglo-Saxon is such a
professional liar that with the plain truth before his eyes
he will still profess to be seeing something else. Nevertheless 
we make the attempt because we believe that a
double benefit may accrue to us thereby. Does any reader
who lived through the years from 1914 to 1919 and is still
living remember what “Democracy” was? It was the
U-need-a Biscuit advertised by Messrs. Woodrow Wilson,
Lloyd George, Georges Clemenceau and thousands of perspiring 
publicists, preachers and thinkers, who were on
one side of a conflict then raging in Europe.

Now, you cannot get men to go out and get killed by
telling them plainly that you who are sending them want
to get the other fellow’s land, trade and wealth, and you
are too cowardly or too intelligent to go yourself and risk
getting shot over the acquisition. That would never do.
So you whoop it up with any catchword which will
serve as sufficient bait for the silly fools whom you keep
silly in order that you may always use them in this way.
“Democracy” was such a catch-word, and the honorable
gentlemen to whom we referred above advertised it for all
it was worth—to them. But, just as we prophesied in
1915, there was an unavoidable flare-back. When you advertise
U-need-a Biscuit incessantly people will want it;
and when you advertise democracy incessantly the people
to whom you trumpet forth its deliciousness are likely to
believe you, take you at your word, and, later on, demand
that you make good and furnish them with the article for
which you yourself have created the appetite.

Now, we Negroes, Egyptians and Hindus, under the
pressure of democracy’s commercial drummers, have developed 
a democratic complex which in its turbulent insistence 
is apt to trouble the firms for whom these drummers 
drummed. Because they haven’t any of the goods
which they advertised in the first place, and, in the second
place, they haven’t the slightest intention of passing any
of it on&mdash;even if they had.

So, gentlemen, when you read of the Mullah, of Said
Zagloul Pasha and Marcus Garvey or Casely Hayford;
when you hear of Egyptian and Indian nationalist uprisings, 
of Black Star Lines and West Indian “seditions”&mdash;kindly 
remember (because we know) that these fruits
spring from the seeds of your own sowing. You have
said to us “U need a biscuit,” and, after long listening to
you, we have replied, “We do!” Perhaps next time&mdash;if
there is a next time&mdash;you will think twice before you
furnish to “inferior” peoples such a stick as “democracy”
has proved for the bludgeoning of your heads. In any
case your work has been too well done for even you to
obliterate it. The Negro of the Western world can truthfully 
say to the white man and the Anglo-Saxon in particular, 
“You made me what I am today, I hope you’re
satisfied.” And if the white man isn’t satisfied&mdash;well, we
should worry. That’s all. &mdash;July, 1920.

### Our Larger Duty

The problem of the twentieth century is the problem
of the Color Line. But what is the Color Line? It is the
practice of the theory that the colored and “weaker” races
of the earth shall not be free to follow “their own way
of life and of allegiance,” but shall live, work and be governed 
after such fashion as the dominant white race may
decide. Consider for a moment the full meaning of this
fact. Of the seventeen hundred million people that dwell
on our earth today more than twelve hundred million are
colored&mdash;black and brown and yellow. The so-called
white race is, of course, the superior race. That is to say,
it is on top by virtue of its control of the physical force
of the worldships, guns, soldiers, money and other resources. 
By virtue of this control England rules and robs
India, Egypt, Africa and the West Indies; by virtue of
this control we of the United States can tell Haytians,
Hawaiians and Filipinos how much they shall get for
their labor and what shall be done in their lands; by virtue 
of this control Belgium can still say to the Congolese
whether they shall have their hands hacked off or their
eyes gouged out&mdash;and all without any reference to what
Africans, Asiatics or other inferior members of the
world’s majority may want.

It is thus clear that, as long as the Color Line exists,
all the perfumed protestations of Democracy on the part
of the white race must be simply downright lying. The
cant of “Democracy” is intended as dust in the eyes of
white voters, incense on the altar of their own self-love.
It furnishes bait for the clever statesmen who hold the
destinies of their people in their hands when they go fishing 
for suckers in the waters of public discussion. But it
becomes more and more apparent that Hindus, Egyptians,
Africans, Chinese and Haytians have taken the measure
of this cant and hypocrisy. And, whatever the white
world may think, it will have these peoples to deal with
during this twentieth century.

In dealing with them in the past it has been considered
sufficient that the white man should listen to his own
voice alone in determining what colored peoples should
have; and he has, therefore, been trying perpetually
to “solve” the problems arising from his own assumption 
of the role of God. The first and still the simplest
method was to kill them off, either by slaughter pure
and simple, as in the case of the American Indians and
the Congo natives, or by forcibly changing their mode of
life, as was done by those pious prudes who killed off the
Tasmanians; or by importing among them rum, gin,
whiskey and consumption, as has been attempted in the
case of the Negroes of Africa and North America. But,
unlike the red Indians and Tasmanians, most of these
subject peoples have refused to be killed off. Their
vitality is too strong.

The second method divides itself into internal and
external treatment. The internal treatment consists in
making them work, to develop the resources of their
ancestral lands, not for themselves, but for their white
overlords, so that the national and imperial coffers may
be filled to overflowing, while the Hindu ryot, on six
cents a day, lives down to the level of the imperialist
formula:

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse leadingquote">“The poor benighted Hindoo,</div>
<div class="verse">He does the best he kin do;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">He never aches</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For chops and steaks</div> 
<div class="verse">And for clothes he makes his skin do.”</div>
</div>
</div>
The external treatment consists of girdling them with
forts and battleships and holding armies in readiness to
fly at their throats upon the least sign of “uppishness” or
“impudence.”

Now, this similarity of suffering on the part of colored
folk has given, and is giving, rise to a certain similarity
of sentiment. Egypt has produced the Young Egypt
movement; India, the Swadesha, the All-India Congress,
and the present revolutionary movement which has lit
the fuse of the powder-keg on which Britain sits in India
today; Africa has her Ethiopian Movement which ranges
from the Zulus and Hottentots of the Cape to the Ekoi
of Nigeria; in short, the darker races, chafing under the
domination of the alien whites, are everywhere showing
a disposition to take Democracy at its word and to win
some measure of it for themselves.

What part in this great drama of the future are the
Negroes of the Western world to play? The answer is
on the knees of the gods, who often make hash of the
predictions of men. But it is safe to say that, before the
Negroes of the Western world can play any effective part
they must first acquaint themselves with what is taking
place in that larger world whose millions are in motion.
They must keep well informed of the trend of that
motion and of its range and possibilities. If our problem
here is really a part of a great world-wide problem, we
must make our attempts to solve our part link up with
the attempts being made elsewhere to solve the other
parts. So will we profit by a wider experience and perhaps 
be able to lend some assistance to that ancient
Mother Land of ours to whom we may fittingly apply
the words of Milton:

“Methinks I see in my mind a mighty and puissant
nation, rousing herself like a strong man after sleep and
shaking her invincible locks; methinks I see her like an
eagle mewing her mighty youth and kindling her undazzled 
eyes at the full noon-day beam; methinks I see
her scaling and improving her sight at the fountain itself
of heavenly radiance, while the whole noise of timorous
and flocking birds&mdash;with them also that love the twilight&mdash;hover around, 
amazed at what she means, and in their
useless gabble would prognosticate a year of sects and
schisms.” &mdash;The New Negro, August, 1919.

### Help Wanted for Hayti

While we were at war our President declared, over and
over again, that we were calling upon the flower of our
manhood to go to France and make itself into manure
in order that the world might be made safe for democracy.
Today the deluded people of the earth realize that the
accent is on the “moc(k).” Ireland, India and Egypt are
living proofs that the world has been lied to. We need
not bite our tongues about it. Those who told us that the
world would be made safe for democracy have lied to
us. All over the world men and women are finding out
that when an American President, a British Premier or a
French “tiger” speaks of “the world,” he does not include
the black and brow: and yellow millions, who make up
the vast majority of the earth’s population. And now
the sheeted ghost of a black republic rises above the
tomb where its bones lie buried and points its silent but
accusing finger at American democracy. What can we
answer in the case of Hayti? British India and Ireland,
Turkish Armenia or Russian Poland have never presented
such ruthless savagery as has been let loose in Hayti in
a private war for which President Wilson has never had
the consent of Congress. The white daily papers speak
complacently of the repulse of “bandits.” What is this
but a developing disease of the American conscience,
to put the blinkers of a catchword over the eyes of the
spirit?

The people of Hayti are being shot, sabred and bombed,
while resisting an illegal invasion of their homes, and, if
public decency is not dead in America white and black
men and women will insist that Congress investigate this
American Ireland.

When Ireland feels the pressure of the English heel,
the Irish in America make their voices heard and help to
line up American public opinion on their side. When
Paderewski’s government massacres Jews in Poland, the
Jews of America raise money, organize committees, put
the U. S. Government on the job&mdash;and get results. But
when Negroes are massacred&mdash;not in Africa, but in Hayti,
under American control&mdash;what do we American Negroes
do? So far, nothing. But that inaction will not last.
Negroes must write their Congressmen and Senators concerning 
the atrocity perpetrated at Port au Prince last
week. They should organize committees to go before
Congress and put the pitiful facts, demanding investigation, 
redress and punishment.

For as long as such things can be done without effective
protest or redress, black people every where will refuse
to believe that the democracy advertised by lying white
politicians can be anything but a ghastly joke.

### The Cracker in the Caribbean

> “Meanwhile the feet of civilized slayers have woven
across the fair face of the earth a crimson mesh of murder
and rapine. The smoke of blazing villages ascends in
lurid holocaust to the bloody god of battles from the altar
of human hate in the obscene temple of race prejudice.”

These words, which we wrote in 1912, come back to 
our mind eight years later with no abatement of the awful
horror which they express. And what gives a special
point to them at this moment is the bloody rape of the
republics of Hayti and Santo Domingo which is being
perpetrated by the bayonets of American sailors and
marines, with the silent and shameful acquiescence of
12,000,000 American Negroes too cowardly to lift a voice
in effective protest or too ignorant of political affairs to
know what is taking place. What boots it that we strike
heroic attitudes and talk grandiloquently of Ethiopia
stretching forth her hands when we Africans of the dispersion 
can let the land of L’Ouverture lie like a fallen
flower beneath the feet of swine?

The facts of the present situation in that hapless land
are given in the current issue of *The Nation* (a white
American weekly). Taken together with the accounts
which we have printed from time to time, it tells a tale of
shuddering horror in comparison with which the Putumayo 
pales into insignificance and the Congo atrocities of
Belgium are tame. The two West Indian republics have
been murderously assaulted; their citizens have been shot
down by armed ruffians, bombed by aeroplanes, hunted
into concentration camps and there starved to death. In
their own land their civil liberties have been taken away,
their governments have been blackjacked and their property 
stolen. And all this by the “cracker” statesmanship
of “the South,” without one word of protest from that
defunct department, the Congress of the United States!

The Constitution of the United States says that the
power to declare war shall belong exclusively to the Congress 
of the United States. But the Congress of the
United States has been shamelessly ignored. In furtherance 
of the God-given “cracker” mandate to “keep the
nigger in his place,” a mere Secretary of the Navy has
assumed over the head of Congress the right to conquer
and annex two nations and to establish on their shores
the “cracker-democracy” of his native Carolina slave-runs.

It is high time that the Negro people of the United
States call the hand of Josephus Daniels by appealing to
the Legislature of the United States to resume its political 
functions, investigate this high-handed outrage 
nd impeach the Secretary of the Navy of high
crimes and misdemeanors against the peace and good
name of the United States. The ordinary excuse of
cowards will not obtain in this case. We would not be
violating any law&mdash;wartime or other&mdash;but, on the contrary, 
we should be striving to put an end to a flagrant
violation of the Constitution itself on the part of a high
officer, who took an oath to maintain, support and defend
it. This is our right and our duty. Irishmen, on behalf
of Ireland, sell the bonds of an Irish loan to free Ireland
from the tyranny of Britain&mdash;with whom we are on
friendly terms&mdash;on the very steps of New York’s City
Hall, while we black people are not manly enough to get
up even a petition on behalf of our brothers in Hayti.

Out upon such crawling cowardice! Rouse, ye slaves,
and show that the spirit of liberty is not quite dead
among you! You who elected “delegates” to go to a
Peace Conference to which you had neither passport nor
invitation, on behalf of bleeding Africa, get together and
present a monster petition to the American Congress, over
which you have some control. Remember that George the
Third engaged in a contest with these colonies because he
had trouble at home. He could not defeat the Pitts,
Burkes and Foxes at home, and wanted to win prestige
from the colonials. Had he succeeded in setting his foot
on their necks he would have returned home with increased 
prestige and power to bend the free spirits of

England to his will. Pitt knew this, and so did Fox and
Burke. That is why they took the side of their distant
cousins against the British king. And the British liberals
of today thank their memories for it. If the “crackers”
of the South can fasten their yoke on the necks of our
brothers overseas, then God help us Negroes in America
in the years to come!

If we were now appealing directly to the white men of
America we might dwell upon the moral aspects of the
question. But we must leave that to others. Yet we
cannot do so without recalling the words of a great poet:

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent2">"But man, proud man,</div>  
<div class="verse">Drest in a little brief authority,</div>
<div class="verse">Most ignorant of what he’s most assured&mdash;</div>
<div class="verse">His glassy essence&mdash;like an angry ape,</div>
<div class="verse">Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven</div>
<div class="verse indent2">As make the angels weep.”</div>
</div>
</div>

And we draw some slight consolation from the fact
that, even if he should escape impeachment, Josephus
Daniels must surrender up his “brief authority” in another
twelvemonth.

But we who are still free in a measure must not wait
twelve months to act. We could not do that and preserve
our racial self-respect. For&mdash;

<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse leadingquote">“Whether conscious or unconscious, yet Humanity’s vast
frame</div>
<div class="verse">Through its ocean-sundered fibres feels the gush of joy
or shame;</div> 
<div class="verse">In the gain or loss of one race all the rest have equal
claim.”</div>
</div>

### When Might Makes Right

A correspondent whose letter appears elsewhere raises
the question of the relation between mental competence
and property rights. “Does inability to govern destroy
title to ownership?” he asks. The white race assumes an
affirmative answer in every case in which the national
property of darker and weaker races are concerned and
deny it in cases in which their own national property
interests are involved. It seems strange that whereas the
disturbances occurring in our own southern states are
never considered sufficient to justify the destruction of
their sovereignty, on the other hand, such disturbances
occurring in Hayti or Mexico are considered a sufficient
reason for invasion and conquest by white Americans.
The same is true of England, France and Italy. A disturbance 
in Alexandria, Delhi, Ashanti or the Cameroons
suffices to fix upon those territories and cities the badge
of inferiority and incompetence to rule themselves. The
conclusion is always drawn in such cases that the white
race has been called by this fortunate combination of
circumstances to do the ruling for them. But similar disturbances 
occurring in Wales, Essen or Marseilles would
never be considered as sufficient to justify the dictatorship 
of foreign powers in the interest of “law and order.”

The truth is that “might makes right” in all these cases.
White statesmen, however, often deny this at the very
moment when they are using “force without stint, force
to the utmost” to establish “rights” which they claim over
territories, peoples, commerce and the high seas. Their
characteristic hypocrisy keeps them from telling the
truth as plainly as Von Bernhardi did in his now famous
book, “Germany and the Next War.” The “sociological”
reason for this hypocrisy is the fact that they need to
preach “goodness,” “right” and “justice” to those over
whom they rule in order that their ruling may be made
easy by the consequent good behavior of the ruled. But
they themselves, however good, must practice ruthlessness, 
injustice and the rule of the strong hand to make
their governance go. It is this fact which causes intelligent
Negroes, Filipinos, Chinese and Egyptians to spurn with
contempt the claims which Caucasian diplomats, statesmen, 
writers and missionaries make on behalf of their
moral superiority. They lie; they know that they lie, and
now they’re beginning to know that we know it also.
This knowledge on our part is a loss of prestige for them,
and our actions in the future, based upon this knowledge,
must needs mean a loss of power for them. Which is,
after all, the essential fact.

### Bolshevism in Barbados

Among the newspapers in Barbados there is a charming 
old lady by the name of the *Barbados Standard*. From
time to time this faded creature gets worried about the
signs of awakening observable in those Negroes who
happen to be living in the twentieth century. Then she
shakes and shivers, throws a few fits, froths at the mouth,
and, spasmodically flapping her arms, yells to all and
sundry that there is “Bolshevism among Negroes.”

Recently this stupid old thing and its congeners have
discovered evidences of a Bolshevist R--r--r--revolution
in Trinidad, and, presumptively, all over the British West
Indies. Now the specter which these fools fear is nothing
but the shadow cast by the dark body of their own system
of stiff-necked pride, stark stupidity and stubborn injustice 
whenever the sun of civic righteousness rises above
the horizon of sloth and ignorance. But, like fools afraid
of their own shadows, they point at the thing for which
they alone are responsible and shriek for salvation.

We shouldn’t care to suggest to them that to lie down
and die would be one good way to avoid these fearful
shadows, because we see the possibility of another way.
Let them resolve that they will cease making a lie of
every promise of liberty, democracy and self-determination 
that they frantically made from 1914 to 1919. Let
the white Englishman learn that justice exists not only
for white Englishmen, but for all men. Let him get off
the black man’s back, stand out of the black man’s light,
play the game as it should be played, and he will find
very little need for wasting tons of print paper and
thousands of pounds in a crusade against the specter of
Bolshevism.

<hr>

### A New International

In the eyes of our overlords internationalism is a thing
of varying value. When Mr. Morgan wants to float a
French or British loan in the United States; when Messrs.
Wilson, Clemenceau, Lloyd George and Orlando want to
stabilize their joint credit and commerce; when areas like
the Belgian Congo are to be handed over to certain rulers
without the consent of their inhabitants—then the paans
of praise go up to the god of “internationalism” in the
temple of “civilization.” But when any portion of the
world’s disinherited (whether white or black) seeks to
join hands with other groups in the same condition, then
the lords of misrule denounce the idea of internationalism
as anarchy, sedition, Bolshevism and disruptive propaganda.

Why the difference? It is because the international
linking up of peoples is a source of strength to those who
are linked up. Naturally, the overlords want to strengthen
themselves. And, quite as naturally, they wish to keep
their subject masses from strengthening themselves in the
same way. Today the great world-majority, made up of
black, brown and yellow peoples, are stretching out their
hands to each other and developing a “consciousness of
kind”&mdash;as Professor Giddings would call it. They are
seeking to establish their own centers of diffusion for
their own internationalism, and this fact is giving nightmares 
to Downing street, the Quai d’Orsay and other
centers of white capitalist internationalism.

The object of the capitalist international is to unify and
standardize the exploitation of black, brown and yellow
peoples in such a way that the danger to the exploiting
groups of cutting each other’s throats over the spoils may
be reduced to a minimum. Hence the various agreements,
mandates and spheres of influence. Hence the League of
Nations, which is notoriously not a league of the white
masses, but of their gold-braided governors. Faced by
such a tendency on the part of those who bear the white
man’s burden for what they can get out of it, the darker
peoples of the world have begun to realize that their first
duty is to themselves. A similarity of suffering is producing 
in them a similarity of sentiment, and the temper
of that sentiment is not to be mistaken.

To the white statesmen “civilization” is identical with
their own overlordship, with their right and power to
dictate to the darker millions what their way of life and
of allegiance shall be. To this the aroused sentiment of
the world’s darker majority demurs. They want to be as
free as England, America or France. They do not wish
to be “wards of the nations” of Europe any longer. And
the problem for the white statesmen of the future will be
to square democracy with the subjection of this dark
majority. Can they achieve either horn of this dilemma?
Can they effect a junction of the two?

Frankly, we doubt it. Continued suppression may be
fraught with consequences disastrous to white overlordship. 
In any case the tendency toward an international
of the darker races cannot be set back. Increasing
enlightenment, the spread of technical science, and the
recently acquired knowledge of the weak points of white
“civilization” gained by the darker peoples during the
recent World War, are enough to negative such a supposition. 
The darker peoples will strive increasingly for
their share of sunlight, and if this is what white “civilization” opposes, then white “civilization” is likely to have
a hard time of it.

### The Rising Tide of Color

Mr. William Randolph Hearst, the ablest white publicist 
in America, has broken loose, and, in a recent
editorial in the New York *American*, has absolutely 
endorsed every word of the warning recently
issued by Lothrop Stoddard in his book,
“The Rising Tide of Color.” In justice to Mr. Hearst,
it must be pointed out (as we ourselves did in 1916) that
he saw this handwriting on the wall long ago. Mr. Hearst
is not particularly famous as a friend of the darker races;
but one must give him credit for having seen what was
involved in the war between the white nations of Europe
and America. As far back as 1915, the present writer
was engaged in pointing out to white people that the racial
aspect of the war in Europe was easily the most important, 
despite the fact that no American paper, not even
Mr. Hearst’s, would present that side of the matter for
the consideration of its readers. Now, however, they
are beginning to wake up&mdash;as people generally do when
disaster is upon them&mdash;frantically with much screaming
and flapping of arms. But, in such cases, the doom approaching 
is but the ripened result of deeds that have
been done, and is, therefore, absolutely inescapable.

The white race has lied and strutted its way to greatness 
and prominence over the corpses of other peoples. It
has capitalized, christianized, and made respectable,
“scientific,” and “natural,” the fact of its dominion. It
has read back into history the race relations of today,
striving to make the point that previous to its advent on
the stage of human history, there was no civilization or
culture worthy of the name. And with minatory finger it
admonishes us that if it were to pass off the stage as the
controlling factor in the World’s destiny, there would be
no civilization or culture remaining. Naturally, we take
exception to both these views, because, for the past, we
know better and, for the future, we think better of the
many peoples who make up the cycle of civilization.

But these conditions are not the gravest at present.
The fact of most tremendous import is that the white race
in trying to settle its own quarrels has called in black,
brown and yellow to do its fighting for it, with the result
that black, brown and yellow will learn thereby how to
fight for themselves, even against those whom they were
called in to assist. The white race cannot escape from its
dilemma, however. If it were to decree hereafter that
wars between whites should be restricted to whites alone,
then we should be given the poignant spectacle of the
white race continuing to cut its own throat while the
increasing masses of black, brown and yellow remained
unaffected by that process, “It is to laugh,” as the
cynical gods would say. Or, to use a trite Americanism,
it is, “heads I win, tails you lose.” It is thumbs down for
the white race in the world’s arena, and they are to be
the dealers of their own death blow. Such are the consequences 
of conquest!

The analogies between the present situation of the white
race and the situation of the Roman Empire in the fourth
century of the Christian era are too many and striking
to be easily ignored. Now, as then, we have “barbarians”
and “super-men.” Now, as then, the super-men are such
in their own estimation. Now, as then, they have, as
they fondly think, a monopoly of the money power, brain
power and political power of the world. Now, as then,
the necessities of their own selfishness and greed, constrain 
and compel them to share their education and their
culture with the races whom they exploit. Now, as then,
in the crisis of their fortunes, they must utilize the knowledge 
and abilities of these barbarian folk, and now, as
then, this exercising of abilities on behalf of the overlord
develops abilities and ambition at an equal rate; and,
having given the barbarian tiger its first taste of blood,
the unleashed results can not now be restrained.

In the Roman days, as in the days of Charlemagne’s
successors, those who hold the balances generally also
wield the sword; and if *their* blood and sand determine
which among the rulers shall get the prizes of victory,
then these same qualities must needs urge them to take
from such victors-by-proxy so much of the fruits of victory 
as their own needs may suggest or their own power
maintain. Truly “they that take the sword shall perish
by the sword.”

### The White War and the Colored Races

[The following article was written in 1918 when the Great
War still raged. It was written for a certain well known radical
magazine; but was found to be “too radical” for publication at
that time. It is given now to the Negro public partly because
the underlying explanation which it offers of the root-cause
of the war has not yet received treatment (even among socialistic 
radicals) and partly because recent events in China, India,
Africa and the United States have proved the accuracy of its
forecasts.]

&mdash;

The Nineteenth Christian Century saw the international expansion 
of capitalism—the economic system of the white peoples
of Western Europe and America-and its establishment by
force and fraud over the lands of the colored races, black and
brown and yellow. The opening years of the Twentieth Century
present us with the sorry spectacle of these same white nations
cutting each other’s throats to determine which of them shall
enjoy the property which has been acquired. For this is the
real sum and substance of the original “war aims” of the belligerents; 
although in conformity with Christian cunning, this
is one which is never frankly avowed. Instead, we are fed
with the information that they are fighting for “Kultur” and “on
behalf of small nationalities.” Let us look carefully at this
camouflage.

#### The Sham of “Democracy”

In the first place, we in America need not leave our own land
to seek reasons for suspecting the sincerity of democratic professions. 
While we are waging war to establish democracy three
thousand miles away, millions of Negroes are disfranchised in
our own land by the “cracker” democracies of the Southern
States which are more intent upon making slaves of their
black fellow-citizens than upon rescuing the French and
Belgians from the similar brutalities of the German Junkers.
The horrible holocaust of East St. Louis was possible only
in three modern States&mdash;Russia of the Romanoffs, Turkey and
the United States&mdash;and it ill becomes any one of them to
point a critical finger at the others.

But East St. Louis was simply the climax of a long series
of butcheries perpetrated on defenseless Negroes which has
made the murder rate of Christian America higher than that of
heathen Africa and of every other civilized land. And, although
our government can order the execution of thirteen Negro
soldiers for resenting the wholesale insults to the uniform of the
United States and defending their lives from civilian aggressors,
not one of the murderers of black men, women and children
has been executed or even ferreted out. Nor has our war Congress 
seen fit as yet to make lynching a Federal crime. What
wonder that the Negro masses are insisting that before they
can be expected to enthuse over the vague formula of making
the world “safe for democracy” they must receive some assurance 
that their corner of the world&mdash;the South&mdash;shall first
be made “safe for democracy!” Who knows but that perhaps
the situation and treatment of the American Negro by our own
government and people may have kept the Central Powers
from believing that we meant to fight for democracy in
Europe, and caused them to persist in a course which has
driven us into this war in which we must spend billions of
treasure and rivers of blood.

It should seem, then, that “democracy,” like “Kultur,” is more
valuable as a battle-cry than as a real belief to be practised by
those who profess it. And the plea of “small nationalities” is
estopped by three facts: Ireland, Greece and Egypt, whose
Khedive, Abbas Hilmi, was tumbled off his throne for failing to
enthuse over the claims of “civilization” as expounded by Lord
Grey.

#### Sir Harry Johnston Speaks

But this is merely disproof. The average American citizen
needs some positive proof of the assertion that this war is being
waged to determine who shall dictate the destinies of the darker
peoples and enjoy the usufruct of their labor and their lands.
For the average American citizen is blandly ignorant of the major
facts of history and has to be told. For his benefit I present the
following statement from Sir Harry Johnston, in “The Sphere”
of London. Sir Harry Johnston is the foremost English authority
on Africa and is in a position to know something of imperial
aims.

> “Rightly governed, I venture to predict that Africa will, if we
are victorious, repay us and all our allies the cost of our struggle
with Germany and Austria. The war, deny it who may, was
really fought over African questions. The Germans wished, as
the chief gain of victory, to wrest rich Morocco from French
control, to take the French Congo from France, and the Portuguese 
Congo from Portugal, to secure from Belgium the richest
and most extensive tract of alluvial goldfield as yet discovered.
This is an auriferous region which, properly developed, will, when
war is over, repay the hardest hit of our allies (France) all that
she has lost from the German devastation of her home lands.
The mineral wealth of trans-Zambezian Africa&mdash;freed forever,
we will hope, from the German menacemis gigantic; only
slightly exploited so far. Wealth is hidden amid the seemingly 
unprofitable deserts of the Sahara, Nubia, Somaliland
and Namaqua. Africa, I predict, will eventually show itself
to be the most richly endowed of all the continents in valuable 
vegetable and mineral substances.”

There is the sum and substance of what Schopenhauer would
have called “the sufficient reason” for this war. No word of
“democracy” there, but instead the easy assumption that, as a
matter of course, the lands of black Africa belong to white
Europe and must be apportioned on the good old principle:&mdash;

<div class="verse leadingquote">“... the simple plan,</div>
<div class="verse">That he shall take who has the power,</div>
<div class="verse">And he must keep who can.”</div>

#### The Economics of War

It is the same economic motive that has been back of every
modern war since the merchant and trading classes secured control 
of the powers of the modern state from the battle of Plassy
to the present world war. This is the natural and inevitable
effect of the capitalist system, of what (for want of a worse
name) we call “Christendom.” For that system is based upon
the wage relationship between those who own and those who
operate the gigantic forces of land and machinery. Under this
system no capitalist employs a worker for two dollars a day unless
that worker creates more than two dollars’ worth of wealth for
him. Only out of this surplus can profits come. If ten million
workers should thus create one hundred million dollars’ worth
of wealth each day and get twenty or fifty millions in wages, it is
obvious that they can expend only what they have received, and
that, therefore, every nation whose industrial system is organized
on a capitalist basis must produce a mass of surplus products over
and above, not the need, but the purchasing power of the nation’s
producers. Before these products can return to their owners as
profits they must be sold somewhere. Hence the need for foreign
markets, for fields of exploitation and “spheres of influence” in
“undeveloped” countries whose virgin resources are exploited in
their turn after the capitalist fashion. But, since every industrial
nation is seeking the same outlet for its products, clashes are
inevitable and in these clashes beaks and claws&mdash;armies and navies&mdash;must come into play. Hence beaks and claws must be provided 
beforehand against the day of conflict, and hence the
exploitation of white men in Europe and America becomes
the reason for the exploitation of black and brown and yellow
men in Africa and Asia. And, therefore, it is hypocritical and
absurd to pretend that the capitalist nations can ever intend
to abolish wars. For, as long as black men are exploited by
white men in Africa, so long must white men cut each other’s
throats over that exploitation. And thus, the selfish and
ignorant white worker’s destiny is determined by the hundreds
of millions of those whom he calls “niggers.” “The strong too
often think that they have a mortgage upon the weak; but
in the domain of morals it is the other way.”

#### The Color Line

But economic motives have always their social side; and this
exploitation of the lands and labor of colored folk expresses
itself in the social theory of white domination; the theory that
the worst human stocks of Montmartre, Seven Dials and the
Bowery are superior to the best human stocks of Rajputana or
Khartoum. And when these colored folk who make up the overwhelming 
majority of this world demand decent treatment for
themselves, the proponents of this theory accuse them of seeking
social equality. For white folk to insist upon the right to manage 
their own ancestral lands, free from the domination of
tyrants, domestic and foreign, is variously described as “democracy” 
and “self-determination.” For Negroes, Egyptians and
Hindus to seek the same thing is impudence. What wonder, then,
that the white man’s rule is felt by them to rest upon a seething
volcano whose slumbering fires are made up of the hundreds of
millions of Chinese, Japanese, Hindus and Africans! Truly has it
been said that “the problem of the 20th Century is the problem of
the Color Line.” And wars are not likely to end; in fact, they
are likely to be wider and more terrible&mdash;so long as this theory
of white domination seeks to hold down the majority of the
world’s people under the iron heel of racial repression.

Of course, no sane person will deny that the white race is, at
present, the superior race of the world. I use the word “superior”
in no cloudy, metaphysical sense, but simply to mean that they
are on top and their will goes&mdash;at present. Consider this fact
as the pivotal fact of the war. Then, in the light of it, consider
what is happening in Europe today. The white race is superiorits 
will goes&mdash;because it has invented and amassed greater means
for the subjugation of nature and of man than any other race. It
is the top dog by virtue of its soldiers, guns, ships, money, resources 
and brains. Yet there in Europe it is deliberately burning 
up, consuming and destroying these very soldiers, guns,
ships, money, resources and brains, the very things upon which
its supremacy rests. When this war is over, it will be less able
to enforce its sovereign will upon the darker races of the worid.
Does any one believe that it will be as easy to hold down Egypt
and India and Persia after the war as it was before? Hardly.

#### The Racial Results of the War

Not only will the white race be depleted in numbers, but its
quality, physical and mental, will be considerably lowered for a
time. War destroys first the strongest and bravest, the best
stocks, the young men who were to father the next generation,
The next generation must, consequently, be fathered by the
weaker stocks of the race. And thus, in physical stamina and
in brain-power, they will be less equal to the task of holding down
the darker millions of the world than their fathers were. This
was the thought back of Mr. Hearst’s objection to our entering
the war.

He wanted the United States to stand as the white
race’s reserve of man-power when Europe had been bled white.
But what will be the effect of all this upon that colored majority
whose preponderant existence our newspapers ignore? In
the first place, it will feel the lifting of the pressure as the iron
hand of “discipline” is relaxed. And it will expand, when that
pressure is removed, to the point where it will first ask, then
demand, and finally secure, the right of self-determination. It
will insist that, not only the white world, but the whole world,
be made “safe for democracy.” This will mean a self-governing 
Egypt, a self-governing India, and independent African states
as large as Germany and France&mdash;and larger. And, as a result,
there will come a shifting of the basis of international politics
and business and of international control. This is the living
thought that comes to me from the newspapers and books that
have been written and published by colored men in Africa and
Asia during the past three years. It is what I have heard from
their own lips as I have talked with them. And, yet, of this
thought which is inflaming the international underworld, not a
word appears in the parochial press of America, which seems
to think that if it can keep its own Negroes down to servile lip-service, 
it need not face the world-wide problem of the “Conflict
of Color,” as Mr, Putnam-Weale calls it.

But that the more intelligent portions of the white world are
becoming distressingly conscious of it, is evident from the first
great manifesto of the Russian Bolsheviki last year when they
asked about Britain’s subject peoples.

And the British workingmen have evidently done some thinking 
in their turn. In their latest declarations they seem to see
the ultimate necessity of compelling their own aristocrats to forego 
such imperial aspirations as that of Sir Harry Johnston,
and of extending the principle of self-determination even to the
black people of Africa. But eyes which have for centuries
been behind the blinkers of race prejudice cannot but blink
and water when compelled to face the full sunlight. And Britain’s 
workers insist that “No one will maintain that the Africans
are fit for self-government.” And on the same principle (of
excluding the opinion of those who are most vitally concerned)
Britain’s ruling class may tell them that “No one maintains that
the laboring classes of Britain are fit for self-government.” But
their half-hearted demand that an international committee shall
take over the British, German, French and Portuguese possessions 
in Africa and manage them as independent nationalities(?)
until they can “go it alone,” would suggest that their eyesight is
improving.

To sum it all up, the war in Europe is the result of the desire
of the white governments of Europe to exploit for their own
benefit the lands and labor of the darker races, and, as the war
continues, it must decrease the white man’s stock of ability to
do this successfully against the wishes of the inhabitants of those
lands. This will result in their freedom from thralldom and the
extension of political, social, and industrial democracy to the
twelve hundred million black and brown and yellow peoples of
the world. This, I take it, is what President Wilson had in
mind when he wished to make the world “safe for democracy.”
But, whether I am mistaken or not, it is the idea which dominates
today the thought of those darker millions.
